      <p class="first first-in-chapter first-full-width"><span class="first-phrase">The call came down</span> to Blackhurst in May of nineteen sixty-eight, just after the Easter holidays.</p>
      <p class="subsq">Lord Sykes needed girls.</p>
      <p class="subsq">As the head of the especially secret service that deals with dark wizards and dragons and all that, his lordship could normally find whoever he needs without even picking up a phone. He could just walk into the bar at the agency's Pall Mall headquarters and find firebrand priests, tame sorcerers, and even old Bobby O’Shea, busy fleecing the juniors at backgammon.</p>
      <p class="subsq">But as it turns out, he didn’t have so many teenage girls in his address book. Lady Sykes probably wasn’t keen on that sort of thing.</p>
      <p class="subsq">So, the call came down to Blackhurst, the agency training college, to rustle up some trainees. And apparently it was urgent enough that that Professor Beaumont had come to yank me and Bridget out of class, and told us to pack a bag.</p>
      <p class="subsq">“Are you really taking those knuckledusters?” I watched as Bridget pushed things into her old satchel in our bedroom.</p>
      <p class="subsq">She was one of those buxom, outdoors types, with honey blonde hair and sparkling blue eyes set into a heart-shaped face. If she wasn’t so pretty you might’ve even called her stocky. She was my fellow first year, my roommate since September, and she'd become a good bit more than that besides.</p>
      <p class="subsq">“What did you think I had them for?”</p>
      <p class="subsq">I laughed. “We’re going to a girls’ boarding school!”</p>
      <p class="subsq">“My point exactly.”</p>
      <p class="subsq">I supposed she would know. She’d spent seven years at boarding school herself and had only left when she'd turned eighteen to come and study here. Most of the students at Blackhurst had done exactly that too. Things were modern enough that we had girls in the agency, but not so modern that we’d let any old oik in.</p>
      <p class="subsq">I would never normally have had a shot at being invited, since my da is a vet, not a viscount, and I just went to the little school in Templepatrick. But I’d been rescued by an agent when I was twelve, from a coven of witches who’d been trying to kidnap me and make me join their little family.</p>
      <p class="subsq">Just like the Docherty girls, the agency had seen something in me. They call it the gift. Born with magic in my blood, just about the rarest thing anyone can be born with. Everyone can work magic if they read the right dusty books, but I had a natural talent. My voice.</p>
      <p class="subsq">If you’ve ever seen a soprano shatter a wine glass, you’ll get the idea. Except I can do it with people. Bridget liked her knuckledusters, and I loved that she was the sort of girl who owned them, but I didn’t need anything like that to be dangerous.</p>
      <p class="subsq">I turned back to my own bag, already packed with a selection of odds and ends for dealing with the occult. Salt and sage, cherry blossom, tincture of woodruff, all that sort of stuff. Useful, even if it wasn’t quite as showy as Bridget’s brass knuckles.</p>
      <p class="subsq">Although, actually, they weren’t brass. They were cold-forged iron, one of the few things that could give the magical a proper whack in the intangibles.</p>
      <p class="subsq">“Ladies?” One of the college’s black-uniformed porters called from our door.</p>
      <p class="subsq">We looked at each other, nodded and then headed out.</p>
      <p class="subsq">We got out the front door just as a silver Rolls Royce pulled up. It stopped, and the driver hurried around to open the back door. A slim woman in a long, mauve coat with a fur collar elegantly stepped out, like she was arriving to the red carpet. She shook out her corkscrew curls and sashayed up to us.</p>
      <p class="subsq">For a moment she just looked from me to Bridget and back again. I felt a bit like she was a jeweller, and I had to do my best to look like a diamond.</p>
      <p class="subsq">“Well, in a pinch, you might just pass for schoolgirls...”</p>
      <p class="subsq">And I supposed she was right. We’d only been at Blackhurst for about seven months, but neither of us looked like we belonged at school any more.</p>
      <p class="subsq">I still had the same long, auburn hair as I always had, the same green eyes, but even when I was home at Christmas my da said he could see the difference.</p>
      <p class="subsq">I was still a bit willowy, as he liked to say, but even I had put on a bit of muscle over the past few months, learning to box and running miles every morning. Blackhurst had toughened me up and made me carry myself differently. Not the quiet, dreamy girl I had been when I left in September.</p>
      <p class="subsq">Nothing would get rid of my Belfast accent, but the agency had already rubbed off on me.</p>
      <p class="subsq">“You’ll do.” And just like that, she turned on her heel and headed back to the car.</p>
      <p class="subsq">So that was Lady Gough. I’d never met her, but of course I’d heard of her. Everyone had heard of her, she was a bit of a legend in the agency, especially to us girls. She must be nearly sixty, but she was still effortlessly glamorous and very old Hollywood with that head of ash blonde curls.</p>
      <p class="subsq">The driver stood there holding the car door and gave us an expectant look.</p>
      <p class="subsq">We hurried to climb in behind her, and the door thunked shut. I hadn’t even got my seatbelt on before the car was moving off.</p>
      <p class="subsq">“You must call me Penny.” She pulled out a silver cigarette case, slipped one into an ivory holder and lit it with an equally silver lighter. “And I don’t want you to worry too much about being dragged out like this. This is how the agency works.”</p>
      <p class="subsq">She rolled down the window and blew smoke out. “Whatever’s going on, it’s probably pretty low-key. Most things are. There’s a good chance we’ll waste our Thursday chaperoning schoolgirls around and discover absolutely nothing. Even if there is something magical, chances are it'll just be some old artefact tucked away somewhere, and we’ll throw it in the boot and come home.”</p>
      <p class="subsq">Bridget and I both nodded, trying to make a good impression. Penny wasn’t a teacher, but her word carried a lot of weight in the agency.</p>
      <p class="subsq">“We are just going to have a nice, quiet look around, alright? Keep your eyes peeled for the usual. Magic circles, blood sacrifices, anything like that.”</p>
      <p class="subsq">“Penny?” I automatically put my hand up without thinking, then realised I was being silly. “...What’s actually been going on?”</p>
      <p class="subsq">She sniffed. “That depends on who you ask.” She flicked ash. “The girls swear blind there’s a ghost in one of the sixth form dormitories. Which is the sort of thing they say about every school, eh? Except that this ghost has gone from a ghostly face at the window to rifling through draws in just a few days.”</p>
      <p class="subsq">She shook her head. “And then last night, one of the girls took a tumble down four flights of stairs, which she had no business being anywhere near, and which are supposed to be kept locked.”</p>
      <p class="subsq">Her eyes narrowed. “Now, you know and I know, that there’s no such thing as a ghost that could do all that by itself. There are plenty of nasties that might well do someone a mischief, but they don’t appear from nowhere and start getting aggressive just like that. And they definitely don’t appear in Batley uniform unless someone asked them to. It could all be nonsense and a girl who’d been at the Babycham slipped on the stairs. But...”</p>
      <p class="subsq">She looked expectantly at us.</p>
      <p class="subsq">“...Better safe than sorry?” Bridget took a punt. She was good like that.</p>
      <p class="subsq">“Quite. If it is some spirit, someone wanted it to do all this, escalating from being creepy to making a very determined effort to kill someone in less than a week. And if that’s the case, it’ll get a lot worse, quickly.”</p>
      <p class="subsq">I made an effort to keep my end up too. “If it happened last night, why did we only get the call this morning?”</p>
      <p class="subsq">Penny shrugged. “Batley College isn’t known to us. And those outside the circle often find it hard to know where to report these things. It took a little while to trickle down the grapevine.”</p>
      <p class="subsq">Bridget piped up again. “Yorkshire, right?”</p>
      <p class="subsq">“...And yes, just down the road from your alma mater at Harrogate Ladies’ College. Mrs Bryson sends her regards, by the way. She was the one who looped us in.”</p>
      <p class="subsq">I rolled my eyes. It was a bit bloody tiresome to always be chasing after occult happenings in posh surroundings.</p>
      <p class="subsq">“In any case...” Penny pushed on with her briefing. “The headmistress doesn’t exactly know what we do, only that I come highly recommended. She does not feel it would be appropriate to close the school, since she has short shrift for ghost stories, and does not wish to worry the girls unduly. Hence why I am bringing the two of you and not the heavy mob.”</p>
      <p class="subsq">I brightened up a bit. “So we don’t actually have to dress up as schoolgirls?”</p>
      <p class="subsq">She laughed. “Well, never say never. But for the moment we will just blend into the background. You might not suit gymslips anymore, but not even the most paranoid pupil will think the two of you are an arm of the state. And I dare say the girls will feel more willing to talk to you two if something untoward is afoot.”</p>

      <p class="first first-in-section first-full-width"><span class="first-phrase">It was a fairly</span> long drive up to Batley, and it was almost two o’clock by the time we pulled up outside. It was a rather nice-looking Georgian building that you could be convinced used to be a country house. We were met by a headmistress whose tightly pulled-back bun told us exactly who she was. Even before the car stopped I instinctively checked that my skirt was properly below the knee.</p>
      <p class="subsq">I went to open my door but Penny nudged me.</p>
      <p class="subsq">“Wait for Blethers.”</p>
      <p class="subsq">I fought not to laugh. “Why?”</p>
      <p class="subsq">“Stature.” She looked perfectly at ease as she watched someone who had summoned us on an urgent mission milled around and waited for us. “We are in charge. And I’m so bally important that I pay a man to come and open my doors. So, she can wait and let our magnificence sink in.”</p>
      <p class="subsq">Blethers, who must be a good deal older than Penny, made his way around and opened the door. Penny stepped out first, her mink-lined Marisol coat still exuding style.</p>
      <p class="subsq">Bridget and I bundled out behind her. The two of us were rather more sedate, since we’d just been pulled out of a morning class. Dark skirts, white blouses, and inconspicuous jackets. Unremarkable. Like we might have come from secretarial college.</p>
      <p class="subsq">But if you were bright you might notice that neither of us wore makeup or jewellery, we always wore sensible shoes and had our hair tied back. Like we might be expecting to do something athletic and dangerous at a moment’s notice.</p>
      <p class="subsq">“Mrs Sutter.” Penny nodded to our headmistress. “I am Lady Gough. We spoke this morning. These are my girls. Bridget and Lissy.” She pointed each of us out in turn.</p>
      <p class="subsq">“Thank you for coming.” Our headmistress really sounded like she meant that too. “Where do you want to start?”</p>
      <p class="subsq">“Ladies?” Penny looked around to us.</p>
      <p class="subsq">I managed to beat Bridget to it this time. “What can you tell us about the girl who got hurt?”</p>
      <p class="subsq">Mrs Sutter sighed. “Patricia Walstead. Lower sixth, Wrenthorpe house. And she had nothing to do with anything else as far as I knew. All the... The sightings... Have been over in Lightcliffe’s dorms, on the other side of the school.”</p>
      <p class="subsq">“Is she alright?”</p>
      <p class="subsq">“She’s got a nasty concussion. Broken wrist. Cuts and bruises.” Mrs Sutter cleared her throat. “The doctor set her wrist, and I’ve kept her here with Matron. Kept it very quiet. I told the girls in her dorm she’s poorly, but that’s all they know. No-one else is too bothered so far. Thank God.”</p>
      <p class="subsq">Bridget joined in. “Is she awake?”</p>
      <p class="subsq">“No. The doctor left her with some painkillers, and she... Well, she did get a nasty bump.”</p>
      <p class="subsq">Penny took charge again. “Let’s start with the scene of the crime, eh?”</p>
      <p class="subsq">“Of course.” Mrs Sutter turned and led us into the school, turning left, then right, and all the way down towards the back.</p>
      <p class="subsq">“So, is Patricia normally the sort of girl who’d fall to her death of an evening?” Bridget asked it with such oblivious optimism.</p>
      <p class="subsq">I struggled not to laugh. Her gifts were definitely more physical than academic, but she was sharper than people thought, and she absolutely did that sort of thing on purpose.</p>
      <p class="subsq">“Well, no. She’s a good girl. Bright, musical. She’s nice. Quiet. But nothing bad in her.”</p>
      <p class="subsq">“How does she get on with the other girls?”</p>
      <p class="subsq">“Well... There was something a year or so back. About someone reading her diary, something like that, and you know what girls can be like. They gave her a hard time. But she just stuck it out and ignored them.”</p>
      <p class="subsq">“What about the usual suspects?” Penny shot in.</p>
      <p class="subsq">“She’s not the sort to do drugs. And I haven’t had a single joint in over a year anyway. I dare say that there’s the odd bottle of vodka squirrelled away, but I couldn’t smell it on her.”</p>

      <p class="first first-in-section first-full-width"><span class="first-phrase">As we carried</span> on down the corridor, I noticed we were away from the actual schooly parts of the school. The doors we were passing were to kitchens and laundry, not to classrooms.</p>
      <p class="subsq">“Honestly, we don’t even get a lot of smoking here. I tolerate the older girls if they insist. But only a few do. As long as the younger girls hide it I don’t make a fuss, because it’s not worth the tears. But if they aren’t even really smuggling in ciggies, I don’t believe there can be much dope up here.”</p>
      <p class="subsq">I tried a different tack. “What about the other usual suspects?”</p>
      <p class="subsq">“Boys?” Mrs Sutter scoffed.</p>
      <p class="subsq">Bridget shot me a playful look. “You’ll have to forgive Lissy, Mrs Sutter. She was a day girl. Never got the hang of boarding.”</p>
      <p class="subsq">Where I came from, you just went to school, and you weren’t a day girl or a bloody boarder. But I supposed Mrs Sutter needed to think we were all from the same world.</p>
      <p class="subsq">“Well, no. Absolutely no boys here, on pain of death.”</p>
      <p class="subsq">I noticed she hadn’t really answered my question. “But was she dressed like she might be meeting someone?”</p>
      <p class="subsq">That got a very long sigh. “She was just in her nightie. But she was wearing lipstick. And I found a compact next to her too.”</p>
      <p class="subsq">I frowned. “So... Did she stop to do her makeup on the stairs?”</p>
      <p class="subsq">“I haven’t the slightest. But those stairs are staff only, and I’ll swear blind those doors are always locked. Always. Laundry goes up and down that way, but that’s during the day. And on the floor she fell from, that door is always locked. We never use it. So not an obvious place to do anything.”</p>
      <p class="subsq">Bridget thought about that. “Well, it would be deserted, right? And if everyone knows it’s always locked maybe she thought no-one would look for her there?”</p>
      <p class="subsq">Mrs Sutter shook her head. “I don’t know. It was so strange. She didn’t have a key, at least not that I could find. And all the doors into that stairwell were locked. And Mrs Stanmore found her right away, she heard her land, and she had to unlock the door to get in.”</p>
      <p class="subsq">“When did it happen?”</p>
      <p class="subsq">“Just after midnight.”</p>
      <p class="subsq">“Didn’t feel the need to call an ambulance?” Bridget sounded too amiable for anyone to take offence.</p>
      <p class="subsq">Our headmistress looked pained. “We’re out in the sticks here, it would take hours. And Matron thought she wasn’t badly hurt. Which is a minor miracle, but the doctor agreed. A bump on the back of her head, but nothing more. He said that if she was in hospital they would just monitor her anyway.”</p>
      <p class="subsq">Mrs Sutter pulled a ring of keys out of her handbag as we got to the far end of the corridor and an unassuming door with a ‘staff only’ sign. “Here we are.”</p>
      <p class="subsq">Penny took the keys out of her hand without asking. “Thank you. I think we’ll just take a look by ourselves first. Helps to just follow the evidence without preconceived notions.”</p>
      <p class="subsq">“Oh, er, of course.”</p>
      <p class="subsq">Penny found the right key on the first try and unlocked the door but kept the key ring with her. She hauled open the heavy door and Bridget and I hurried through. She stepped in herself and let the door close behind us.</p>
      <p class="subsq">“Alright, let’s make ourselves useful, shall we?”</p>
      <p class="subsq">It was, boringly, just a stairwell. A single square room, with a shaft up the middle so you could see all the way up. The first stairs were on our right, then you went across at a half-landing, past a window, then back towards us and up the left wall, to get to the next door up, right above where we were standing. There was one more flight going down from here too, I supposed leading to a basement. All the stairs were very narrow, and I could see why they didn’t want hundreds of girls thundering up and down.</p>
      <p class="subsq">I slowly turned on the spot, taking in the whole place. The banisters did look a bit flimsy, which was supported by the second landing’s banister having a hole smashed through it. There were splinters of wood all over the place, and various bits of debris down here on the ground floor.</p>
      <p class="subsq">Bridget hitched her skirt up and squatted down beside the patch of flotsam. There was a little bloodstain at one end. “Well, we know where she landed, eh?”</p>
      <p class="subsq">Penny ran her eye over the scene. “Perhaps not why, though?” She offered me the bunch of keys. “Head up to the second floor. See what’s up there.”</p>
      <p class="subsq">I took them, making sure to keep hold of the stairwell key and started up towards the shattered banisters. As I got there I frowned at the landing. There were a lot of bits of banister up here too. I tentatively looked down to the ground floor. It was a proper drop, twenty feet or so.</p>
      <p class="subsq">Penny was pacing around the scene. “Be a body for me, would you, Bridget?”</p>
      <p class="subsq">“Oh... Right...”</p>
      <p class="subsq">I smirked as I watched her lay down, trying to fit herself into the gap in the middle of the firewood. I suspected Patricia was a bit skinnier than Bette.</p>
      <p class="subsq">“It’s a bit...” She squirmed around.</p>
      <p class="subsq">“Face up though, eh?”</p>
      <p class="subsq">Bridget blinked. “Well... She hit the back of her head so...?”</p>
      <p class="subsq">Penny looked up to me. “What do you think, Lissy?”</p>
      <p class="subsq">I looked around the landing. “So, what? She had her back to the banister, doing her lipstick, lent back against it and it gave way? So, she fell backwards?”</p>
      <p class="subsq">Penny walked over to the first set of stairs and grabbed the still solid banister. She yanked it aggressively, and there was a tiny bit of flex, but it didn’t creak or anything. “I wouldn’t bet my life on them but...”</p>
      <p class="subsq">She went up two steps, extracted a compact from her coat, flipped it open and lent back against the banister as she pretended to powder her nose. “Not the most comfortable but it doesn’t seem life threatening.”</p>
      <p class="subsq">I turned back and looked at the door onto my landing. I gave it an experimental push. It was locked too, but the key happily opened it up. I pushed the door again, and it swung open onto another corridor. This looked rather more schooly to me. Display boards dotted the walls between doors that had numbers on them.</p>
      <p class="subsq">I took a couple of steps along, noticing that the carpet up by this door was barely worn, but once you got to the first classroom it started to look more lived in. Mrs Sutter was right, the door was almost totally unused. I very cautiously peered through the window in the first door and got a glimpse of girls in Batley’s maroon blazers.</p>
      <p class="subsq">I left it at that and came back to the stairwell door. I frowned at it, peering at the varnished wood, almost mirror finished. I reached into my old school bag and found a little glass bottle with silvery-grey powder. Not anything fancy, just crushed chalk and charcoal to make a uniform grey. You could use it for magical things, since it was apparently very neutral, which made it good if you needed to draw a magic circle or something. But it had more mundane uses too.</p>
      <p class="subsq">I shook the bottle, then slid out the stopper, which had a light dusting of powder, and extended a hand towards the door. You’d obviously push it just above the keyhole, that’s where your hand would fall.</p>
      <p class="subsq">I held the stopper an inch or so away from the wood and blew over it, sending a little stream of the dust against the wood. Nothing seemed to happen.</p>
      <p class="subsq">I moved up and down and kept blowing, but there really weren’t any finger marks, or even signs it had been wiped. I checked the keyhole too, but nothing again. I put the bottle away and nudged the door with my shoulder, leaving the lack of prints alone, in case Penny wanted a look.</p>
      <p class="subsq">“No fingerprints up here, Penny.” I called down.</p>
      <p class="subsq">She nodded. “And the sixth form dorms are all up on the top floor. You wouldn’t sneak down the main stairs after lights out, then come into the back stairs here, would you?”</p>
      <p class="subsq">“No.”</p>
      <p class="subsq">Penny offered Bridget a hand and hauled her upright. “So, how do you arrive down there on your back?”</p>
      <p class="subsq">All of us looked up and down the stairwell.</p>
      <p class="subsq">Bridget shrugged. “Well, we do supposedly have a poltergeist, don’t we? Throws things around?”</p>
      <p class="subsq">Penny nodded approvingly. “So, threw her off further up? And she was just lucky enough to hit that landing and partly break her fall?”</p>
      <p class="subsq">I tiptoed a little closer to the edge. “There is a lot of woodwork still up here. And...” I looked back across. “If you crashed into the banister from that side, you’d maybe have your hands up in front of you. Then she’d break her wrist going through? Then she slips back and straight down off the edge? Feet first almost. And when she bangs her head, it’s only from the last few feet of falling?”</p>
      <p class="subsq">“Let’s have a look then.”</p>
      <p class="subsq">We started up the stairs, stopping on the half-landing towards the third floor, looking back towards the door I had just checked.</p>
      <p class="subsq">“It’s a fair old distance.” Bridget gave it a professional eye. “Lissy’s a twig but I couldn’t just hurl her across like that. Don’t know how big Patricia is, but...”</p>
      <p class="subsq">We went up two more flights, onto the next half-landing, between the third and fourth floors. I threw my arm out to stop the others just as we got to the top. “There!” It was an orange smear on the carpet. I went ahead and crouched down, tentatively touching a fingertip to it, then rubbing it between the thumb and finger. “...It’s face powder.”</p>
      <p class="subsq">“Didn’t break the banisters up here.” Bridget confidently stated the obvious. “So... You’d be thinking more... Up and over? Maybe she was leaning on this side?” She traced the trajectory in the air, lifting Patricia over the banister, all the way across then straight down at the bottom.</p>
      <p class="subsq">Penny laughed sourly. “Luckiest girl I’ve ever seen. Falling four floors, the best part of fifty feet. That should be a death sentence. You’d have to think whatever threw her, it meant her never to get up.” She shook her head. “Anyway, that looks like magic to me. So, the two of you can start looking. I’ll see if I can’t deduce how she got into the stairwell.”</p>
      <p class="subsq">I passed Penny the keys back as she went past me, and Bridget and I crowded together on the half-landing, starting to look for anything else here. There really wasn’t a lot to see, though.</p>
      <p class="subsq">“So, er, can you see anything?” Bridget smiled hopefully at me.</p>
      <p class="subsq">I sighed. I supposed it was inevitable. “Alright, sure.” I took a breath, running through a quick little exercise to help me focus. My fingertips tapped together in rhythm, counting breaths in and out, clearing my mind.</p>
      <p class="subsq">I let my eyes go out of focus, trying to look with a different sense entirely. I had got better at perceiving magic, it came to me more easily now, but I really couldn’t do it just by looking. I still had to properly reach for it. It felt like trying to read Braille, something like that, slow and deliberate, at least until I found the first letter.</p>
      <p class="subsq">Nothing happened at all.</p>
      <p class="subsq">“Urgh...”</p>
      <p class="subsq">“Stay still.” Bridget stepped behind me and gently slid her arms around me, hugging me for a second, then reaching up to cover my eyes with her hands. “Take a breath.”</p>
      <p class="subsq">She whispered beside my ear and slowly took a deep breath herself, then let it out. “In. And out.”</p>
      <p class="subsq">I copied her, relaxing back against her. She was good to me.</p>
      <p class="subsq">“That’s more like it.” She kissed my hair behind my ear. “What can you see?”</p>
      <p class="subsq">Against the blackness I started to see violet-green after images, like I had been staring at the sun. I could see it straight through Bridget’s hands.</p>
      <p class="subsq">“There is something here. Feint though. Like a... Woomf...” It was the best way I could describe it. “Like a flash of power.”</p>
      <p class="subsq">“Anything else?” She was still right by my ear.</p>
      <p class="subsq">I slowly turned on the spot, letting her move with me and I glanced around the rest of the stairs. I couldn’t see anything physical here at all, but I tried to follow my memory of what this place looked like. “I don’t know. There’s no marks here. No circles or anything. So... I suppose it was sent here to do Patricia in. The magic wasn’t done here.”</p>
      <p class="subsq">“Good.”</p>
      <p class="subsq">I peered downwards. Patricia’s blood was clearly visible through the stairs, an obvious, rainbow-sheened smear on the ground floor. But nothing else. “I think that’s all she wrote.”</p>
      <p class="subsq">“Alright.” Bridget pecked my neck again.</p>
      <p class="subsq">I felt a little flurry of butterflies, and for a moment I squirmed back against her, but I quickly remembered myself. “We’re supposed to be working...”</p>
      <p class="subsq">She shrugged. “Do you really care if Penny knows?” She pecked me again.</p>
      <p class="subsq">It did take an effort, but I finally stepped away. “No. But... I don’t want her thinking we can’t actually do the job.”</p>
      <p class="subsq">When I turned back to her Bridget was looking very innocent. “Of course.” She mockingly crossed herself and made a three-fingered cub scout salute.</p>
      <p class="subsq">I chuckled. It wasn’t that we were even really trying to keep ourselves secret. More that we were in a very small class, in a very small college, and we would rather not be gossiped at. Since we shared a room we really didn’t have to sneak around to be an item, just not be too obvious when we were at classes.</p>
      <p class="subsq">Bridget’s head snapped around and she frowned. “Wait...” She sniffed a couple of times. “Maybe this place isn’t as locked up as they think?”</p>
      <p class="subsq">I sniffed too and realised it immediately. When we’d all been clustered up I’d thought it was just Penny, but there was still a proper waft of cigarettes here in the stairwell. “Hmm...” I glanced down at the floor, but I couldn’t see ash or anything. “Where did the girls smoke at your school?”</p>
      <p class="subsq">“Out the window. Fire escape. That sort of thing. But... If it was cold and rainy, well, somewhere that’s never used at night isn’t a bad idea. I would probably still crack a window...” She turned around and considered the pane behind us. She flipped the catch and with a bit of effort heaved it up. “...Stiff, but it’s fine. And if you did open it, you probably would get away with it.”</p>
      <p class="subsq">“I don’t think Patricia was here smoking though. At least no-one found her ciggies down there. No fag ends or anything.”</p>
      <p class="subsq">Bridget thought for a second then turned around and leaned out of the open sash. She was grinning when she came back in. “Oh really?” She had a short, ceramic something in her hand that looked like a tea-light holder.</p>
      <p class="subsq">I peered down into it. There were a half-dozen cigarette ends in there, and matchsticks to go with them. Some of them were fresh, but some had almost disintegrated.</p>
      <p class="subsq">“Alright so... Someone smokes here.” I nodded. “And they’ve been in and out for a while, by the looks of it. So, either one of the doors doesn’t actually get locked. Or our someone has a key.”</p>
      <p class="subsq">The door to the fourth floor corridor opened and we looked up expectantly. Penny appeared above us. “Looks to be sixth form studies up here. Nothing very exciting. But you wouldn’t have a problem sneaking over here at night.”</p>
      <p class="subsq">Bridget held up the ashtray. “And someone definitely does sneak down here.”</p>
      <p class="subsq">“Good.” Penny nodded sagely. “Since we’re up here, let’s take a look at Patricia’s dorm, shall we? Can one of you run down and get Mrs Sutter?”</p>

      <p class="first first-in-section first-full-width"><span class="first-phrase">Bridget had taken</span> pity on me and run off down the eight flights. She was the sporty one, and she was a lot quicker than me running all the way down, then back up again.</p>
      <p class="subsq">Mrs Sutter escorted us up into the fourth floor proper, but Penny was right, and the corridor we arrived at was along the back of the building and it was, in fact, just studies. Apparently sixth formers got one between two, to study for their exams and whatnot.</p>
      <p class="subsq">“Wrenthorpe is here.” She pointed up from the corner we were on. “So, Patricia’s dorm will be up there. You want to start there, or...?”</p>
      <p class="subsq">Penny mulled that over. “Yes. She was meeting someone, so anything we can find that might tell us who. Diary or whatever.”</p>
      <p class="subsq">We started up the next corridor, and a minute or so later Mrs Sutter took us into a dormitory that, to my eyes, looked exactly like a dormitory and really wasn’t interesting beyond that. It had beds up the long walls, each with a wardrobe and bedside table, with windows looking out onto the grounds.</p>
      <p class="subsq">Mrs Sutter took us up the aisle in the middle and pointed out one of the beds on the left. “This is Patricia’s.”</p>
      <p class="subsq">It was just a bed, with a nightstand and wardrobe, like all the others.</p>
      <p class="subsq">“Bridget, would you mind ransacking it for me? You know where to look.”</p>
      <p class="subsq">“Yes, Penny.” She said it automatically and made for the bed. For a moment I watched with interest as Bridget efficiently pulled the sheet off and felt into the hospital corners but came up with nothing. It didn’t put her off though, and she slid the drawers out the nightstand and checked the undersides.</p>
      <p class="subsq">“Lissy, would you have a look for anything less obvious?” Penny gave me a look.</p>
      <p class="subsq">I nodded. “Yes, Penny.”</p>
      <p class="subsq">“Well, your girls certainty are better house-trained than mine.” Mrs Sutter sighed.</p>
      <p class="subsq">“Oh, it comes from a terrifying reputation while acting very sweetly.”</p>
      <p class="subsq">I let them chatter and took a step back, out of Mrs Sutter’s line of sight. I closed my eyes and took a long breath, just thinking back to Bridget’s arms around me, and felt out for the magic again. I slowly turned on the spot, but there really didn’t seem to be anything at all. Not even a smudge of colour. I came back around and opened my eyes, then stepped back, caught Penny’s eye and shook my head.</p>
      <p class="subsq">She very fractionally acknowledged me, but didn’t break off talking to Mrs Sutter. The three of us watched Bridget remaking the bed, having probed through every nook and cranny.</p>
      <p class="subsq">“Nothing, Penny.” She shrugged. “Or nothing that looks promising.”</p>
      <p class="subsq">“No school bag?”</p>
      <p class="subsq">Mrs Sutter shrugged. “Probably in her study.”</p>
      <p class="subsq">I glanced around the room and realised what we had missed. Everyone else had books and letters and pictures. But Patricia’s bed looked very bare. “She didn’t really leave anything here, did she?”</p>
      <p class="subsq">The headmistress sighed again. “Well, yes, she has been a bit... Cagey. Secretive, almost. Not in a bad way. But it was a knock to her. Just... Gossip and rumours and...”</p>
      <p class="subsq">“Bullying, even?” Penny asked it very lightly.</p>
      <p class="subsq">“...You know what girls are like. And as far as I know, she just ignored them until they got bored and found something else to squabble over.”</p>
      <p class="subsq">“Bit concerning that she ends up damn near dead, though...”</p>
      <p class="subsq">Mrs Sutter held up a hand defensively. “That was over and done with a year ago. Of course I felt for her, but she never complained. And it was never, ever physical. And she’s been absolutely fine since.”</p>
      <p class="subsq">“Well, let’s see what’s in her study.”</p>
      <p class="subsq">We trooped back up the corridor and Mrs Sutter consulted a list of studies as we got back to the stairs we had come up.</p>
      <p class="subsq">“How many sixth formers do you have?”</p>
      <p class="subsq">“Forty. Fully subscribed... Patricia is in number sixteen.” She took us about halfway up the corridor, knocked and, when there wasn’t an answer, turned the knob and let herself in.</p>
      <p class="subsq">I called from behind. “They don’t lock them?”</p>
      <p class="subsq">“No. They can lock the desks and the drawers, but it helps discourage bad behaviour if they can’t lock themselves in.”</p>
      <p class="subsq">I peered over Mrs Sutter’s shoulder. The study was a nice enough little space. There was a desk against each wall, each with a set of drawers, and a radio sat on the windowsill. It looked much more lived in than Patricia’s bedroom at any rate. I looked from one desk to the other. One side had Bob Dylan posters, the other side had Janis Joplin and Mama Cass. There were books and notepads very much in evidence.</p>
      <p class="subsq">“Which one is which?” I asked.</p>
      <p class="subsq">“Oh... No idea.”</p>
      <p class="subsq">Penny lazily waved me and Bridget in. “Well, give it a proper seeing to, eh?”</p>
      <p class="subsq">Bridget got in first and quickly put that keenly honed investigative instinct to use. “There’s a bag here.” She hauled it up onto the Janis Joplin desk and started leafing through it. “Patricia.” She held up an exercise book with the name on.</p>
      <p class="subsq">I left her to look at the bag and tried the top draw, which was locked. “Do you have a key for this, Mrs Sutter?”</p>
      <p class="subsq">“Somewhere, maybe. Not something we carry around.”</p>
      <p class="subsq">I looked to Penny. “Should I force it?”</p>
      <p class="subsq">“Best not.”</p>
      <p class="subsq">I squatted down and considered it. “Bette’s better at picking but I probably can get it....?”</p>
      <p class="subsq">Penny chuckled. “I won’t put you on the spot.” She went into her handbag and came back with a curious hairgrip that looked like it was made of copper or brass. “You’ll find it’s very good for this sort of lock.” She gave me a wink.</p>
      <p class="subsq">I straightened up and took it off her, then came back to the draw. I wasn’t exactly sure what I was supposed to do with it, but I could feel something off the strip of metal, like it was slightly too warm to be believed. I slid it optimistically into the lock and wiggled it, but I barely needed to bother. There was a very slight static electric sensation, and I felt the pins click into place. There wasn’t even any friction as I turned the hairpin and lock jumped open.</p>
      <p class="subsq">I slid the drawer out and leafed through some old notebooks and odd pages torn out of magazines. Lulu and Twiggy were very much in evidence, but it wasn’t much of a surprise that a schoolgirl was interested in fashion and pop music.</p>
      <p class="subsq">I tried the next draw down and was surprised to find a bible, lying alone by itself with a few bookmarks sticking out of it. I flipped it open to the first one, but it was just a seemingly random page in Exodus.</p>
      <p class="subsq">“Is Patricia a churchy girl, do you know?” I called over my shoulder.</p>
      <p class="subsq">“Not that I noticed.”</p>
      <p class="subsq">I chewed my lip and looked more at the bookmark. It was just a piece of notebook paper, neatly torn out, then torn in half and folded over. But there was a slightly visible something, like the paper had been written on before it had become a bookmark.</p>
      <p class="subsq">I opened it out on top of the bible page, then blinked in surprise.</p>
      <p class="subsq">It was a note, in obviously feminine handwriting.</p>
      <p class="subsq"><i>P - I really would find it flattering. But would you? Xxx - S</i></p>
      <p class="subsq">I went to the next one and found another note, in the same handwriting.</p>
      <p class="subsq"><i>P - It’s alright, you don’t have to say it. I know it’s hard for you. But if you keep answering me, I may make assumptions... Xxx - S</i></p>
      <p class="subsq">I made sure that I didn’t show a response, I just scooped the notes up and dropped them on the desk beside the bag, under Bridget’s nose.</p>
      <p class="subsq">She looked down, read them, then really grinned.</p>
      <p class="subsq">I was smiling too. They were sweet. “Where would you leave a note like that?”</p>
      <p class="subsq">Bridget chuckled. “Not in a dormitory. Certainly not if I knew someone in there reads people’s diaries.”</p>
      <p class="subsq">“Did you...?” Mrs Sutter went to take a step in, but Penny put her arm out across the doorway and stopped her.</p>
      <p class="subsq">“Let them work, Mrs Sutter.”</p>
      <p class="subsq">Bridget stepped back to the door and looked at the desk more critically from that angle. She nodded as she found what she was after. A thick textbook was sat right on the edge, and it looked perfectly normal. She picked it up and let the pages flip through her fingers until one didn’t quite go. She opened it on that page, and slid out a new note, unfolded.</p>
      <p class="subsq">“Nice and easy. Borrow a book, return a book. Who’s going to ask? Just leave it on their desk.”</p>
      <p class="subsq">She dropped the paper on the desk beside the others.</p>
      <p class="subsq"><i>P. After midnight. On the back stairs. XXX. S</i></p>
      <p class="subsq">“Spot the difference?” Bridget cocked an eyebrow.</p>
      <p class="subsq">She was right. The handwriting looked very similar, enough that you wouldn’t really tell unless you put them next to each other. She’d done the little flourish that the real S made on the P, but she hadn’t quite laid it out right. And now I looked at it, the paper wasn’t from the same book. The real notes were half a notebook page. This one was taken from a lined pad, a bit wider, and only had a tear up one side.</p>
      <p class="subsq">I nodded. “Well, it doesn’t help us with who. But if our Patricia is sweet on S, and comes a cropper with a forged note, you’d have to imagine that whoever wrote it is keen on S herself.” I’d been keeping my voice down, not really wanting Mrs Sutter to get caught up on the indelicacy of it all, but we would have to ask. “Do you happen to know anyone who’d be called S? A sixth former, probably?”</p>
      <p class="subsq">Mrs Sutter thought for a long moment. “Sofia?” There was an uncertain pause. “...The ghost was in her dorm.”</p>
      <p class="subsq">Penny sniffed. “Pretty girl, is she?”</p>
      <p class="subsq">“Oh...” Mrs Sutter cleared her throat. “Yes, I’d say so.”</p>
      <p class="subsq">Penny nodded to me and Bridget. “Tidy up. And let’s go and have a look for our ghost.”</p>

      <p class="first first-in-section first-full-width"><span class="first-phrase">I shivered</span> as we came up the corridor to the Lightcliffe’s sixth form dormitory.</p>
      <p class="subsq">“Sorry, there’s a draft up here somewhere.” Mrs Sutter said it like she had felt that same shiver a few times along the corridor. Not a good sign.</p>
      <p class="subsq">“There bloody isn’t.” Penny snapped. “It’s May. Lissy, give this place some serious consideration if you please.”</p>
      <p class="subsq">Magic was one of those funny things. Anything alive had a bit of it in them, not enough to detect, but enough so that their hairs still stood on end when they walked past something powerful. There’s a reason why some places just give you the creeps. I was a bit more sensitive to it than most, but everyone must have felt it.</p>
      <p class="subsq">I glanced at Mrs Sutter. “Should I...?”</p>
      <p class="subsq">Penny nodded immediately. “I’m sure she won’t be bothered, will you Mrs Sutter?”</p>
      <p class="subsq">“Oh, well...”</p>
      <p class="subsq">“Good. Crack on.”</p>
      <p class="subsq">I stepped into the dormitory and sat on the first bed. I set my satchel on my knees and searched inside for matches, taking one out. I took a second to pull a couple of loose hairs out of my plait, then tied them around the stick and held it dangling by them. I drew my hand over it in a circle and muttered a little Gaelic phrase.</p>
      <p class="subsq">“Ní thuaidh ach an fíor-thuaisceart.”</p>
      <p class="subsq">The matchstick jumped up, twitching like a paper kite in a breeze, pulling the hairs behind it.</p>
      <p class="subsq">All magic needed sacrifice. This little charm didn’t need a lot, hair did fine for it. More powerful things needed blood. Even my voice, my natural talent, just cut out the middleman and fed directly from my body.</p>
      <p class="subsq">I stood up from the bed and followed where the compass-charm was leading me. It was much more fiddly and less subtle, but also was a much more reliable way to find magic. Behind me I heard Penny continuing to talk over Mrs Sutter.</p>
      <p class="subsq">“Oh no, it’s a classic, investigative technique so let’s not fuss...”</p>
      <p class="subsq">The charm pointed me towards the far end of the room and I followed it, but as I got nearer to the last window it started to lose focus, the match twitching left then right, not making its mind up about where it was trying to point to.</p>
      <p class="subsq">Bridget touched my back. “What have you got?” I hadn’t realised she had followed me, I’d been too focused on the little stick.</p>
      <p class="subsq">“Don’t know. Something by the window. Something by that bed.”</p>
      <p class="subsq">“Was your ghost seen down here, Mrs Sutter?” Bridget called back up to the door.</p>
      <p class="subsq">“...I think so. It was those end beds that had their things thrown around.”</p>
      <p class="subsq">Penny kept up the barrage of questions. “What did your ghost look like?”</p>
      <p class="subsq">“Like... A girl. One of our girls. Once they said in uniform. Then once in a nightie. But... A girl in the window. Or... The back of her head, anyway. That’s what they say. And sort of... Well, ghostly. White and pale and slightly glowing, I’m told.”</p>
      <p class="subsq">I could definitely feel the static electric sensation of magic in the air. “It’s strong down here.” I thought about it. “Did anyone see the things being thrown around?”</p>
      <p class="subsq">“No. Not that we know of. It happened at lunchtime yesterday.”</p>
      <p class="subsq">I looked around to the beds, trying to ignore the sensation by the window. I closed my eyes again and took a couple of breaths to let the magic sink into my senses so I could see it.</p>
      <p class="subsq">“It looks like... Just like on the stairs. And that’s...” I resisted the urge to look again. I’d lose it if I opened my eyes. “There’s much more by the window. This side has mostly calmed down. It’s over here...”</p>
      <p class="subsq">I turned on the spot. There was a much stronger glow near the window, and a clear, bright something just below it. Not an obvious something. A slightly indistinct shape that was bright but not wholly formed, lines that were slightly broken.</p>
      <p class="subsq">I stayed still and opened my eyes, trying to hold the magical image in my memory for as long as I could as I looked through my mundane senses.</p>
      <p class="subsq">I frowned and stepped towards it. The compass-charm was definitely pointing to the windowsill, but as I ran my fingers over it I couldn’t feel anything.</p>
      <p class="subsq">I crouched down and looked up at the underside of the sill.</p>
      <p class="subsq">“Huh...” I was expecting a proper piece of witchcraft, a little circle inscribed with runes, with blood marked around it to make a real spell. This wasn’t that.</p>
      <p class="subsq">It was graffiti, crudely cut with something. The lines were all longer than they would really need to be, like whatever had been used was too long to do something so small very easily.</p>
      <p class="subsq">It just said ‘S + V’, with a blocky, angular heart around them. I peered at it and I could see there were scraps of blood in the wood. That was odd. When you gave a spell blood, it literally consumed it in a puff of smoke. The scent of significant magic was the reek of burned blood.</p>
      <p class="subsq">There was normally a bit of residue left behind, but this wasn’t that. It had power, and a surprisingly large amount of it too, but it wasn’t a proper spell. It hadn’t taken the offering. But there was enough there to make it light up, and someone had apparently known enough to offer it blood.</p>
      <p class="subsq">I beckoned Bridget over and let her look. She nodded. “There we go.”</p>
      <p class="subsq">We both stood up and I called back to Mrs Sutter again. “Which bed is Sophia’s?”</p>
      <p class="subsq">“Second to last.” I could see Penny was a deliberately keeping her out of the dormitory while we worked.</p>
      <p class="subsq">I looked back to the beds again. I couldn’t still see the smear of arcane light, and the compass-charm was stuck pointing at the graffiti. But I was right across from Sofia’s bed.</p>
      <p class="subsq">“Let’s have a rummage.” I broke the strands of hair off the matchstick, letting it turn back into any other matchstick.</p>
      <p class="subsq">I let Bridget go first again, she knew where to hide things in a dorm. But on this occasion it seemed we didn’t need any special powers. It only took her about thirty seconds to find the notebook we were looking for. She didn’t have Patricia’s notes hidden inside it, sensibly enough, since our girls were trying to be discreet. But we found the torn out pages and that was a good start.</p>
      <p class="subsq">Bridget flipped the notebook open onto the bed and squinted down at the next page over from the last note, trying to read the impressions. “...It’s a big school. We can find somewhere quiet. I want to make it work. I don’t want to just pass notes. Kiss, kiss, kiss. S.”</p>
      <p class="subsq">I licked my lips as I thought it through. “So... Patricia gets this one. And maybe that’s... Tuesday? Or yesterday morning? But then she gets the forged one, right? Just after our poltergeist comes for a look in here.”</p>
      <p class="subsq">Bridget sighed. “If it weren’t for the magic you’d say it was perfectly normal teenage stuff.”</p>
      <p class="subsq">“I always thought that it was boys who fought over girls.”</p>
      <p class="subsq">“Oh, girls fight too.” Bridget kept her voice down and glanced back at the door self-consciously. “Boys aren’t worth fighting over. But for the right girl...”</p>
      <p class="subsq">I bit my lip, and I felt my cheeks get a bit pinker. “...We need to find our V, right?”</p>
      <p class="subsq">“We do. But... What’s up with this spirit? I mean, if we think V is conjuring something to send over here... What did she send it to do?”</p>
      <p class="subsq">That cut through the moment of fuzziness. “I don’t know. Maybe she’s not very good at it? That spell over by the window is just... Amateur. Not even that. Made up.”</p>
      <p class="subsq">“She didn’t have a problem making it do what she wanted to Patricia, did she?”</p>
      <p class="subsq">I gritted my teeth. This case was starting to feel like one of Professor Danby’s exercises. “It’s always easier to work magic when you’re angry, right?”</p>
      <p class="subsq">“So I’m told.” Bridget shrugged one shoulder.</p>
      <p class="subsq">Blackhurst taught us all kinds of little charms, and I had seen her do more impressive things than that compass-charm. But she wasn’t one for spending days pawing over books or understanding the theoretical basis of occult rituals. She was a practical girl.</p>
      <p class="subsq">“Maybe that scratch over there was... I don’t know. Not even supposed to be anything. Maybe last night wasn’t either. Maybe there’s just another little graffiti somewhere that... She was thinking about Patricia and...”</p>
      <p class="subsq">Intention, determination and sacrifice. That was what shaped magic. It was rare that it happened genuinely by accident. But it did happen. That was how humans had discovered magic in the first place. Someone noticed that if you mixed blood into your cave painting and drew a circle around it, maybe when you chanted over it something really did happen.</p>
      <p class="subsq">“And of course, it would be lovely if this were just a misunderstanding.”</p>
      <p class="subsq">I snapped around to see Penny standing right behind me, but her heels hadn’t made a single sound as she came up the dormitory.</p>
      <p class="subsq">“Well...”</p>
      <p class="subsq">“Accidents do happen, ladies. But ours is not the kind of work where we can afford optimism. We’re only here at all because some trivial occult activity became an attempted murder within a few days. Occult activity that clearly is under human direction. Tell me, why do people kill?”</p>
      <p class="subsq">“Love, money or a cause.” Bridget chirped it out, learned by rote.</p>
      <p class="subsq">“Correct. And it would seem love is our motive. Thank God. Because either of the others would be a lot more of a problem in a place like Batley College. But love will do well enough. We are looking for a killer who has magic as their weapon. Unintentionally, perhaps? Who knows. But magic does not kill without intention. So, much as I would love for this to end with some silly girl solemnly promising not to do it again...”</p>
      <p class="subsq">I peered around her towards the door. “Penny, where did Mrs Sutter go?”</p>
      <p class="subsq">Penny didn’t even slightly move. “She recalled some unexpectedly pressing business elsewhere.” Her eyes really hardened at me. “Am I making myself clear? We are not social workers. You are here because you are useful to me. And that’s right enough. You are useful. You’re bright girls and you haven’t missed a step so far. Believe me when I say that I would tell you if you had.”</p>
      <p class="subsq">I nodded quickly. “Yes, Penny.”</p>
      <p class="subsq">“But if you are too kind-hearted to look after yourselves, you will cease to be useful. I cannot hunt a murderer while also holding your hands.” She stopped and took a breath. “I’m not upset with you. This is not a particular failing on your part. I have had seven juniors in the thirty-one years since King George, God rest his soul, gave me his royal warrant and made me a full agent. Seven juniors, all much more seasoned than you, and I have had to tell each of them the same thing.”</p>
      <p class="subsq">The corner of her mouth twitched up, a very fractional smile. “Let us all hope and pray that it may be a misunderstanding. But look around you, ladies. This has the waft of jealousy and obsession. All very teenage. But all the worse for it, because teenagers are given to tantrums and grand gestures. And to believing that a squabble over a pretty girl is far more important than staying alive. So...”</p>
      <p class="subsq">Bridget was always there to back me up. “We’ll be careful, Penny.”</p>
      <p class="subsq">“Good. Now, I think we need to have a word with our Patricia, don’t you think?”</p>
      <p class="subsq">“Should we wait for Mrs Sutter?”</p>
      <p class="subsq">“Oh, I think she might be a while. Sounded awfully important.”</p>
      <p class="subsq">I was still mulling it over. “What are we asking her, Penny?”</p>
      <p class="subsq">“Who tried to kill her. And...” She vaguely waved a hand. “...Clues in that direction, regarding their budding love triangle.”</p>
      <p class="subsq">“Can I question her?” I tried not to sound like I was just trying to get back on Penny’s good side.  “I think I know how to get her to cooperate.”</p>

      <p class="first first-in-section first-full-width"><span class="first-phrase">“Shoo.”</span> Penny flashed something in her palm at Matron that glinted silver. Without a word, Matron immediately remembered something important she had to do elsewhere.</p>
      <p class="subsq">I decided not to ask questions. Agents, proper agents, were allowed to use all kinds of magical artefacts in the course of their duties. It wasn’t very nice to bewitch people who were in the way, but at least it was better than hitting them on the head.</p>
      <p class="subsq">The three of us clustered around the bed. Patricia did look rather the worse for wear, with a big bandage around her head and her arm in plaster. But she had come through the near-certainly fatal drop with surprisingly little to show for it. Other than the fact that she was unconscious.</p>
      <p class="subsq">Penny snapped her fingers over Patricia’s face then sighed and went into her handbag, coming back out with what looked like an address book.</p>
      <p class="subsq">She flipped through pages then held it open and passed it to Bridget. “That should do the trick.”</p>
      <p class="subsq">I craned over her shoulder and looked down at a very aggressively abridged magical text, in Penny’s tight, fluid handwriting. Now I thought about it, it looked just like Sofia’s, and not a million miles from Bridget’s. I supposed that was just what they taught you at fancy schools. Penmanship and other valuable, practical skills.</p>
      <p class="subsq">There was a diagram showing a circle drawn around the subject’s head, like a halo in a stained glass window.</p>
      <p class="subsq">Bridget was already searching in her bag with her free hand. “I think I have an eyeliner in here somewhere...”</p>
      <p class="subsq">I ran my eye down the notes. “Will that be alright? It doesn’t want charcoal or sulphur or anything silly?” It didn’t seem to say, and I didn’t want to make a fuss, so I let Bridget get on with it, and began looking for various little vials that held other ingredients.</p>
      <p class="subsq">“Give me a hand?”</p>
      <p class="subsq">I looked up and realised what Bridget meant. The circle needed to be under Patricia’s head, so she needed to not be in the way. I set down two vials on the bedside table and turned back to lift Patricia up. She still didn’t move at all as I slid my arms under her armpits and pulled her up.</p>
      <p class="subsq">Bridget shoved the pillows off the bed and finished a vaguely round circle. I let Patricia drop down again, and Bridget started to fill in some additional runes around the edge.</p>
      <p class="subsq">I looked back to Penny, but she was just watching impassively, as she had been all day.</p>
      <p class="subsq">It was hard to tell with her, whether she was testing us or teaching us or what. I had been told that agents tended to do that with their juniors, but she also paid a man to open doors for her, so perhaps she just felt trivial bits of sorcery were beneath her.</p>
      <p class="subsq">I took the book off Bridget and quickly deciphered what I was supposed to do with the valerian extract and wormwood. I made a little dab of the thick, green valerian paste under each of her eyes and tentatively sprinkled a pinch of powdered wormwood over her hair.</p>
      <p class="subsq">Bridget looked encouragingly at me, and with a resigned sigh I found the hat pin that I kept in the front pocket of my bag for the purpose. I read through the incantation that the book provided, which Penny had helpfully put down in capitals.</p>
      <p class="subsq">I got it clear in my head, then focused on what the spell was supposed to do. Wake up Patricia. At least that was simple enough.</p>
      <p class="subsq">I took a breath and pricked my fingertip with the pin. I had done it enough times that it didn’t bother me any more, but it was never pleasant.</p>
      <p class="subsq">I held my hand out into the circle, touched my fingertip to Patricia’s forehead, leaving a red smear, and read the magic words.</p>
      <p class="subsq">“Ending darkness to banish the night, merciful Eos bring forth your light.”</p>
      <p class="subsq">I watched as the drip of blood shimmered and rippled and dissolved into the air. And just as it vanished, Patricia’s eyes snapped open.</p>
      <p class="subsq">I set the book down and leaned down over her. “Hello.” I smiled thinly. “Don’t try and move. I think if you move too much you’ll go back to sleep.”</p>
      <p class="subsq">She swallowed. “...What the hell happened?”</p>
      <p class="subsq">“You had a fall.”</p>
      <p class="subsq">She let out a very disbelieving breath.</p>
      <p class="subsq">Bridget leaned over from the other side. “Our thoughts exactly.”</p>
      <p class="subsq">I tried to focus on the important things. “You hit your head. And you’ll be ok. But you’ve mostly been unconscious and had a bit of a concussion. Which is fine, you’ll get better, except... We need to ask you a few questions right now.”</p>
      <p class="subsq">Patricia nodded. “...Right.”</p>
      <p class="subsq">I took a breath. “We’re here investigating all this. You must have heard about the ghosts and all that?”</p>
      <p class="subsq">Another nod.</p>
      <p class="subsq">“We think it’s all connected. To you hitting your head and all. And... I know this might be a bit... A bit difficult.” I cleared my throat. “I’m Lissy. This is Bridget.”</p>
      <p class="subsq">“Hello.” Bridget added helpfully.</p>
      <p class="subsq">I fidgeted, but I was absolutely certain that it would help and get her talking like nothing else could, so just like Patricia I would take my licks.</p>
      <p class="subsq">“Bette’s my girlfriend.” I could instantly feel I was blushing. I hadn’t ever said it out loud. “We aren’t here to rock the boat. Or gossip, alright? We just want to make sure that... Well, if someone was trying to kill you, they don’t get another crack at it.”</p>
      <p class="subsq">Patricia’s eyes darted around uncertainly, but she didn’t stop me.</p>
      <p class="subsq">“You thought you were going to meet Sofia last night, right? For... A romantic stroll... Or a bit of a snog and a fumble, anyway. You thought you were going to meet her. For the first time, I think?”</p>
      <p class="subsq">Patricia very slightly nodded.</p>
      <p class="subsq">“What happened?”</p>
      <p class="subsq">“...A note in my book. Just... The same way she always leaves them.”</p>
      <p class="subsq">“And she wasn’t there?”</p>
      <p class="subsq">“No.” Another swallow. “Not that... I was only there for a minute or two. Just... I was doing my bloody lipstick and then... Wind and falling and... Nothing.”</p>
      <p class="subsq">Bridget joined in. “Didn’t see anyone? Didn’t hear anything?”</p>
      <p class="subsq">“I don’t know. It’s all jumbly. But I don’t remember anything. Except... Whoosh.”</p>
      <p class="subsq">Not very helpful. But it was a start, I could work with that. “Sofia wanted to meet up, right? She’d been leaving you notes for... I don’t think for very long? A week or so maybe?”</p>
      <p class="subsq">Another little nod. “Since the last time we went to Batley.”</p>
      <p class="subsq">I was running on ahead, trying to make pieces fit. “And you were a bit... Unsure, right? Because... I think you might have got bullied. Because you like girls.”</p>
      <p class="subsq">Patricia swallowed. “...Yes.”</p>
      <p class="subsq">Bridget touched her hand. I wasn’t sure if Patricia could feel anything outside the circle, but it was the thought that counts. Bridget had also been a boarding-school girl who’d very much kept her feelings to herself. “I’m sorry. That’s horrid.”</p>
      <p class="subsq">I kept on, following the thread. “And you like Sofia. I think maybe you... Had a moment? That started all this?”</p>
      <p class="subsq">Patricia really squirmed. “...We took a gaggle of the youngsters down to Batley. Normal enough, just keeping an eye on them. And they were... Well, being horrible little buggers. Picking on one of them. Calling her...” She swallowed. “...Calling her a dyke, if you must know. Which...”</p>
      <p class="subsq">She screwed up her eyes. “...Upset me a bit. I don’t... I don’t like that word. And Sof... She snapped at them. Really snapped. Shut them right up. And I said... Thank you. But she shouldn’t worry on my account, you know? And she said she wasn’t and it’s just a nasty thing to call someone, whether or not they fancy girls. And...”</p>
      <p class="subsq">She really chewed her lip and fidgeted. “...What’s so bad about fancying girls anyway. And she probably wouldn’t mind if... A girl... Fancied her... And...” Her eyes flicked open again. “And I don’t know... I so badly didn’t want all that to come around again... But... The way she just... It felt real. And the way she looked at me like...”</p>
      <p class="subsq">She swallowed hurriedly. “...I didn’t really know her until this year. But we have music A-level together now. She plays cello. I play clarinet. And we got on well and... Of course, I... She is just...” She sighed very longingly.</p>
      <p class="subsq">“She’s exactly the kind of girl you would notice? Even if you were being quiet and careful?”</p>
      <p class="subsq">“Of course! She’s...” She sighed again. “... Perfect.”</p>
      <p class="subsq">“Did you ever think anyone knew?”</p>
      <p class="subsq">“No. Not for a second. We were so careful.”</p>
      <p class="subsq">I tried to find the right way to say it. “...The thing is, we think that whoever hurt you... It’s because... She fancies Sofia too. It’s hard to tell but... I think she probably read some of your notes to her. And she knew how to slip you a note too. Maybe followed Sofia? Something. She figured it out. And that’s... She wanted you on the stairs last night.”</p>
      <p class="subsq">“Lord...” Patricia shook her head.</p>
      <p class="subsq">“I know it’s tricky but... We need to figure out who it is. And... We need to do it without her knowing we’re after her. Because she’s already done some nasty things. And if she’s upset... We would rather not have anyone else fall down some stairs, you know?”</p>
      <p class="subsq">Patricia looked very tired. “I don’t know. Really, I don’t. I know... Well, I do happen to have a reputation.” She really glowered. “But Sof definitely doesn’t. I’ve never heard a peep. If someone else fancies her... Of course it’s possible. But it’s only been a week! So, unless someone was already keeping an eye on her?”</p>
      <p class="subsq">“Does anyone else have... A certain reputation?”</p>
      <p class="subsq">“Oh Lord, plenty. Not that it’s true. But it’s always the gossip isn’t it? Someone fancies so-and-so?”</p>
      <p class="subsq">“...Who was it that was getting bullied? Who Sofia looked after on the trip? Maybe starts with a V?”</p>
      <p class="subsq">Patricia blinked a few times. “...Violet Sterling? You can’t...? I mean... God, she does have a reputation, but not for that.”</p>
      <p class="subsq">“For what then?”</p>
      <p class="subsq">She gulped. “Look, I know it’s cruel. And now I’m doing exactly what they did to me, aren’t I? I’m not saying it’s true, I’m saying... This is what the rumours are, alright?”</p>
      <p class="subsq">“Of course.”</p>
      <p class="subsq">“...She went to some private hospital on very short notice. Earlier this year. And when Mrs Miller packed a bag for her, she found pills and razor blades and... All kinds. And I have no bloody idea if it’s true. She’s the year below me, and she’s not even in my house. I don’t know her at all.  I barely even know which one she is, there’s so many of the little buggers. Just... That’s what people say.”</p>
      <p class="subsq">I glanced between Bridget and Penny, but no-one else looked very likely to say something.</p>
      <p class="subsq">“...Do you think... If Violet was to talk to Sofia... In a romantic way... Do you think that’s likely to end with Violet getting upset?”</p>
      <p class="subsq">Patricia laughed, then grimaced. “Probably. Sof is... She has an artistic temperament. It’s the Italian in her. And she... Well, she’s got a sharp tongue on her.”</p>
      <p class="subsq">I tried not to sag, but that was not good news. “Alright, well... We’re going to make sure she’s ok. And you are too, alright?”</p>
      <p class="subsq">Patricia nodded. “Thank you.”</p>
      <p class="subsq">“Could you... What does Sofia look like?”</p>
      <p class="subsq">Her eyes went slightly out of focus, all dreamy. “...Mountains of dark curls. Olive skin. Dark brown eyes. If you like girls you can’t miss her.”</p>
      <p class="subsq">I heard Bridget stifle a titter but I pressed on. “What about Violet?”</p>
      <p class="subsq">“Oh, er... Small. She looks younger than she is. Mousy hair. Pale. Dark circles under her eyes. Always looks tired.”</p>
      <p class="subsq">“Good. That’ll help.”</p>
      <p class="subsq">Her brow furrowed. “Who are you? The two of you look like you’ve just left the sixth form...”</p>
      <p class="subsq">Penny hurried over and scrubbed a finger through the eyeliner circle. Patricia’s eyes snapped shut again. “Probably easier if she doesn’t know, eh?”</p>
      <p class="subsq">Bridget and I hovered.</p>
      <p class="subsq">Penny nodded. “Well, you were right. You could get her talking.”</p>
      <p class="subsq">Somehow just hearing that made me feel a lot more nervous than the prospect of chasing a disturbed schoolgirl who had tried to kill people with magic.</p>
      <p class="subsq">“Yes, Penny.” I swallowed.</p>
      <p class="subsq">“Showing her that you understand her, that’s the ticket.”</p>
      <p class="subsq">I nodded again. “...I thought it would... Help...”</p>
      <p class="subsq">“Yes.” She flashed a thin smile to me. “...At this stage of my career, I’ve stopped asking people if they want my advice. I just tell them what I think they should know.”</p>
      <p class="subsq">I gulped. “Yes, Penny?”</p>
      <p class="subsq">“I don’t need to be Her Majesty’s foremost occult investigator to know the two of you are sweet on each other.” She held up a hand to stop any response. “It’s in your eyes every time you look at each other. And you are good at this work. That’s clear enough. But... You will both have to become better at keeping secrets.”</p>
      <p class="subsq">“...Yes, Penny.”</p>
      <p class="subsq">She cleared her throat. “Not because you have a particular need to keep that one. Our agency is deeply uninterested in your personal lives. But, in general, yes? We do need to play our cards very close in most of our work.”</p>
      <p class="subsq">I nodded again.</p>
      <p class="subsq">For the first time Penny did look a bit uncomfortable. “...In the interim, as you become better at keeping secrets... I would look with great displeasure upon anyone who was unpleasant towards the two of you. Not that you would have need of help from me, I’m sure. But if someone were to take issue, perhaps someone more senior who you might not feel comfortable confronting... No matter how mighty they might think themselves, I assure you, I am more mighty than they.”</p>
      <p class="subsq">I knew she was being nice, and it only felt awkward because everything felt awkward right now.</p>
      <p class="subsq">So, I put a brave face on it and smiled. “I thought I might just scream at them until they exploded.”</p>
      <p class="subsq">Penny chuckled. “Well said. I like a girl who can solve her own problems.” Her face fell, suddenly back to work. “Not that I feel I can approve of this Violet’s approach. At least we have a name. We will have to track her down, but school is over in just a few minutes and she won’t be anywhere in particular until dinner. And she’s shown a talent for being where she’s not supposed to, since apparently she has a key to the back stairs. And that would make it a good deal easier to nose around the sixth form studies.”</p>
      <p class="subsq">We all mulled.</p>
      <p class="subsq">Bridget was the first to come up with something. “She sounds like the sort who’ll have a little nest somewhere. If they bully her, she won’t like the dorm or the common room, will she? She’ll have found somewhere quiet where she can be by herself.”</p>
      <p class="subsq">Penny sniffed. “That sounds about right. Which will make her even harder to find. At least she probably hasn’t fled the school. Mrs Sutter probably would have considered that the only missing girl might be a suspect. But we should check that she has been in her lessons today.” She paused. “But I think you’re right, Lissy, we don’t want her to know we’re asking. So, I will have to track down Mrs Sutter again. In the meantime...”</p>
      <p class="subsq">She smirked. “...Lissy, you’re more sensitive so discreetly track down Sofia and keep an eye on her. Don’t make Bridget jealous, just be on the lookout for any more magic near her. I doubt Violet will attack her paramour, but I dare say she will want a word, and she may like the idea of... A love spell, an enchanted gift, something like that.”</p>
      <p class="subsq">“Yes, Penny.”</p>
      <p class="subsq">“Discreetly, yes? Do not talk to the girls. Do not tell Sofia anything at all. Just keep an eye on her, and if Violet puts in an appearance, nab her.”</p>
      <p class="subsq">I managed to hold in a gasp. “You’re going to use Sofia as bait?”</p>
      <p class="subsq">“Heavens no!” Penny laughed for a moment, then abruptly stopped. “You are.”</p>
      <p class="subsq">“Oh...”</p>
      <p class="subsq">“Bridget, apply as many occult defences as we can to Patricia. Salt and sage, all that. I hope that Violet won’t send anything out to finish the job but we should presume that she might. From there...” Penny growled a bit. “I badly want to ransack her bally dorm, but since that is an obvious place for her to hide things, including herself... Bridget, be poised and use your wit and judgement to deduce which bunk is hers then rummage urgently when everyone is at dinner.”</p>
      <p class="subsq">“Yes, Penny.”</p>
      <p class="subsq">“We’ll meet somewhere around the hall at dinner, alright?”</p>
      <p class="subsq">We all nodded. I handed Bridget my bag, full of our occult supplies, and headed off to embark on the kind of duty the boys in our year could only dream of. To look for the prettiest Italian girl I could find and watch her from afar.</p>

      <p class="first first-in-section first-full-width"><span class="first-phrase">It took</span> me a little while to find Sofia. I was still getting used to this boarding school world. It made sense that there was a common room somewhere, we had one at Blackhurst, but she wasn’t in there and I didn’t want to linger, since I was under orders not to do anything that might make the girls notice me.</p>
      <p class="subsq">Not that I thought Penny was wrong about that. But it would be helpful to ask just about anyone just about anything. Still, at least no-one was paying any attention to me, which was a blessing. As long as I looked like I knew where I was going I really could be some teaching assistant or even a former pupil who had come back for a chat. As long as I seemed confident, I could walk up the wrong corridors all afternoon.</p>
      <p class="subsq">Eventually I managed to establish that the music department actually had its own building beside the main school, but once I’d cracked that part the rest was easy enough. Sofia played the cello and didn’t have any plans to go on a nice romantic stroll with Patricia, so it made sense that she might go and practise of an afternoon.</p>
      <p class="subsq">I could already hear her cello playing from outside. I came in through the double doors and quietly explored around the corridors, following the slightly mournful sound of strings towards what the doors said were practice rooms.</p>
      <p class="subsq">Annoyingly, I couldn’t look in from this side, so I sighed and headed off back outside, looking for a way around to look through the windows from the other side. There were bushes planted up around the walls, and the only path led back towards the school, but that was fine. I’d probably look less suspicious to be leisurely strolling on the grass on a nice spring day instead of peering into windows anyway.</p>
      <p class="subsq">I could still hear her playing as I went, so I wasn’t too worried about missing her. I just set out onto the grass about ten yards away from the block and headed around it. The practice rooms were towards the back on the right-hand side, so I just ambled slowly on, keeping an eye on the windows but not really looking until I turned the corner around the back of the building.</p>
      <p class="subsq">As soon as I got around that side, I could immediately hear the cello much more clearly. And she was certainly good. I wasn’t properly musical, but I sang and I could recognise a bit of artistry when I heard it.</p>
      <p class="subsq">I’d always thought I’d end up with someone more like that, who maybe liked to draw and paint, just like me, or who played the saxophone or something. A bit artistic, you know? Then again, I’d always assumed I’d end up with a lad, so it shows what I knew. At least Bridget liked to watch me paint, and she was a very good model for me.</p>
      <p class="subsq">I didn’t know which room was Sofia’s, or what they looked like inside, so I still kept my distance, staying a few yards back from the bushes. Off in the distance I could see hockey pitches and a couple of dozen girls attacking each other with sticks in what I assumed was the normal course of play. Just another spring afternoon at Batley College.</p>
      <p class="subsq">My eyes kept over to my left, just watching the windows as I walked along. And it really wasn’t hard to pick out who Sofia was. Even if I hadn’t bothered to ask Patricia for a description, I could have guessed which girl inspired obsession and jealousy.</p>
      <p class="subsq">I could sympathise.</p>
      <p class="subsq">She really was strikingly pretty, with that heart-shaped face and dark ringlets spilling around her shoulders. She definitely did look Mediterranean, like you might imagine Helen of Troy or someone like that. And she was sat looking out into the grounds, off towards the left where the sun would eventually set. She had just the hint of a contented smile, like this was exactly where she wanted to be.</p>
      <p class="subsq">Patricia was right. If you had an eye for a lass, you know which girl she’d fallen for.</p>
      <p class="subsq">I slowed right down, watching her as she played. She wasn’t looking towards me, but I didn’t want to make her look around either so I just stood there and watched her through my reflection in the glass, still a few yards away, and off to her right.</p>
      <p class="subsq">Since I was here, I glanced down at the bushes, checking for any voodoo dolls or mandrakes or anything. Nothing like that, but there were cigarette ends dotted around. I supposed that made sense. I bet that you could just smoke out of the window down here and throw the ends out into the bushes where no-one ever came.</p>
      <p class="subsq">I frowned and sniffed, then glanced up and down the line of windows. No-one was actually smoking.</p>
      <p class="subsq">I blinked and looked back up at Sofia. My reflection was right between me and her. But I was off to the side. My reflection couldn’t possibly be bouncing back to me here.</p>
      <p class="subsq">And it seemed very unlikely that my reflection would be taking a puff from a ciggie when I wasn’t smoking.</p>
      <p class="subsq">I muttered under my breath. “Hello, Violet.”</p>
      <p class="subsq">I resisted the urge to jump back from drawing any attention to myself. My eyes carefully scrutinised the rest of the window, but there really wasn’t anyone there. Not an outline, not a shadow, not a hint of a shape.</p>
      <p class="subsq">Plenty of magical things were invisible, and most of them you couldn’t ever see at all without a bit of your own magic. But those invisible things didn’t watch humans. They didn’t have eyes, they didn’t have a brain or even a personality. They liked to be close to humans because they could feed off us. But any kind of spirit could just slide through the wall and sit right on top of Sofia and siphon off her joy, or whatever else upsetting.</p>
      <p class="subsq">A human would watch through the window. A human who knew that Sofia could walk into her, and who knew that Sofia would definitely notice her smoking. It was very human that she knew she’d be here for a while, so she was going to have a ciggie. And it was heartbreakingly human to quietly put herself right there, to Sofia’s left, exactly where she was looking.</p>
      <p class="subsq">I felt a real pang for her.</p>
      <p class="subsq">Violet was in the exact spot where it felt like she and Sofia were eye to eye, like Sofia was smiling back at her as she played.</p>
      <p class="subsq">That was so sad.</p>
      <p class="subsq">I had no idea how Violet had made herself invisible. But she was troubled and lonely and bullied and she had fallen for someone who didn’t even know she existed.</p>
      <p class="subsq">It was bright outside. The reflection wouldn’t even be visible inside the room. I had no idea if Violet knew that her reflection was visible at all, but clearly she knew she could stand here and watch and pretend without Sofia noticing.</p>
      <p class="subsq">And just thinking about it was enough to make my stomach flip over. Of course I understood.</p>
      <p class="subsq">I took a couple of very slow steps back, making sure that I vanished from the window.</p>
      <p class="subsq">I considered the bushes, still a few yards away from me. If you looked with a certain assumption you could see how the branches had been pushed back from the wall just there. Some were trodden down, some were bent. Even if you were a groundskeeper, it didn’t look suspicious. But there was enough space for someone to pick their way through the hedge and linger right there by the window.</p>
      <p class="subsq">I tried to throw off all the sadness that came with understanding Violet’s troubles. I closed my eyes and took deep breaths and went through the little routine to unfocus myself. It was like a clapping game, tapping fingertips together in a slightly different pattern to how I was breathing.</p>
      <p class="subsq">In and out.</p>
      <p class="subsq">And there she was.</p>
      <p class="subsq">Or at least, there was the shape of the magic she’d done to make herself disappear. It made it hard to see any details, it didn’t hug her form exactly, and all of it had that luminous after image quality of magic, a little halo of power radiating away and blurring the edges. There was an oddly crackly quality to it, though, like random horizontal flecks that were brighter and seemed to dance across the surface.</p>
      <p class="subsq">I opened my eyes again, letting the real world come back. I could still see the space that she should be standing in. Definitely inside a bush, right up against the wall. And how exactly was I going to go in there and get her? I had the choice to either somewhat see her or just see the bushes, but not both at the same time, but if she looked around she could see me and she had already made a couple of occult explosions that we knew of.</p>
      <p class="subsq">Penny would say that I should shoot her.</p>
      <p class="subsq">Or, actually, no she wouldn’t. Because, thankfully, she hadn’t thought to give either me or Bridget a gun. That was a blessing.</p>
      <p class="subsq">Agents, and their juniors, were supposed to always carry a sidearm. That was down in the rule book. But I wasn’t an agent, and not even a henchwoman. I was a student, and one who still wasn’t very happy shooting anything, despite weeks of practice. So, no gun for me, and at least Penny couldn’t look down her nose at me for lacking killer instinct.</p>
      <p class="subsq">But beyond shooting Violet, I really wasn’t very sure what else I could do from here. She hadn’t heard me creeping up on her over the cello, but she would have to hear me taking a run-up and definitely jostling the hedge. And while I might just about grab her, I had no plan after that. She would probably reappear if she went unconscious, but that would be tricky to make happen when I couldn’t see her. I'd had six months of intensive Judo classes back at Blackhurst, but we'd never practised on invisible men, or even invisible schoolgirls. And, honestly, the idea of tackling a sad girl and choking her unconscious in a bush was a bit too depressing for me.</p>
      <p class="subsq">If she got free while we were outside, there was no chance we’d ever catch her. If she knew we were chasing her, she could just be out of the gate and in the wind. She might not look like much, but she had done something very nasty to Patricia, and if she even had a fraction of that ready to go then I didn’t have a chance to bring her in alone.</p>
      <p class="subsq">I backed off and left her to it.</p>
      <p class="subsq">If she was going to run anyway, good luck to her. It wouldn’t be because I tipped her off. Everything I had seen in the last few minutes just made me more sure that she would want to talk to Sofia.</p>
      <p class="subsq">So, just like Penny had said, I was going to use Sofia as bait. I was doing what I was told. I was very clear with myself that I was not being a bit squeamish about hitting someone who wasn’t holding up boxing mitts. And definitely not being a bit wet and hoping I could find a happy ending that didn’t involve launching an unprovoked assault on an already suicidal teenage girl.</p>

      <p class="first first-in-section first-full-width"><span class="first-phrase">I waited</span> for Sofia up inside the music block, deciding to put a door between me and Violet, which helped to quiet down the lingering paranoia that came from knowing I was chasing an invisible girl. At least I’d have to hear the door opening.</p>
      <p class="subsq">Sofia kept practising for over an hour, so I just stood and listened out in the corridor, down the far end. It seemed very unlikely that anything too bad could happen to her while she was still playing, and I was close by in case she abruptly stopped. So, I paced a bit, tried to not get too anxious, and waited.</p>
      <p class="subsq">Eventually I heard her finish her last piece, and a minute or two later she came back into the corridor with the big cello case. I lurked, looking like I was fiddling with one of the displays on the wall. She went off to stow the case away in one of the classrooms and headed off out of the block. I let her get out of the door before I went to follow her, wanting to stay a little way back. But that was fine, she was easy enough to spot, and at least for the moment she wasn’t surrounded by other girls.</p>
      <p class="subsq">I paused just outside the music block, and watched Sofia up to the big heavy school doors, then went after her. I got in just in time to see her disappearing up the main stairs inside. No problems at all, I was allowed to be here, so I put back on the expression of someone who knew where they were going and kept on following.</p>
      <p class="subsq">My neck prickled with the, hopefully imaginary, sensation of being watched. I supposed that Violet could be stood right next to me, and I did occasionally swing my arm out further than I needed to, trying to see, but I couldn’t feel anything at all. If she was there, she was just as good at following people as me.</p>
      <p class="subsq">I followed Sofia all the way up to the top floor, then down towards the studies right at the back. I wondered if she was expecting a note from Patricia. The school had done a good job of making sure she wasn’t being gossiped about, and unless they’d been supposed to have a lesson together today, Sofia probably didn’t know. And I had to guess she was still hoping for a snog.</p>
      <p class="subsq">There was a quiet wolf whistle as I went past a slightly ajar door and I jumped around. Bridget opened the door a bit further, and I could see she was hiding in a linen closet. At least it looked cosy.</p>
      <p class="subsq">“That was Sofia, eh?” Her eyebrows bounced suggestively. “You can see why they like her.”</p>
      <p class="subsq">I giggled. “She’s away to her study.”</p>
      <p class="subsq">“Alright. I’m just staying out of the way until dinner. The dorm downstairs is full of the little sods. Not seen Violet though.”</p>
      <p class="subsq">“You wouldn’t.” I gave Bridget a look. “She’s invisible.”</p>
      <p class="subsq">She groaned. “Wonderful. Stick with Sofia. I’ll see you in a bit.”</p>
      <p class="subsq">I nodded and hurried off after Sofia, who had just disappeared around the corner towards the studies.</p>
      <p class="subsq">We hadn’t known which study belonged to Sofia, but I took a note of it as she let herself in. It was quiet along here right now, I supposed people were either actually studying or were already somewhere else, so I just went on after her and stopped at the door just before hers.</p>
      <p class="subsq">I really jumped as a bell clanged through the halls a minute or two later. It took me a second to realise that was probably for dinner, and for about a third of a second I felt relieved before I remembered that a lot of girls would be pouring past me and wondering what the hell I was doing here, standing still and doing nothing.</p>
      <p class="subsq">Doors started opening up and down the corridor and I just took a gamble, quickly opening the door behind me and stepping back into the study. I hadn’t heard anyone inside, and no-one had moved at the bell, so I just slid in and hugged the wall it shared with Sofia’s study next door. I would definitely hear her door.</p>
      <p class="subsq">I gave her a minute or so, letting the sounds of sixth formers gossiping and marching off towards dinner die away before I started to get concerned.</p>
      <p class="subsq">I was certain I hadn’t heard her leaving. I really didn’t know if dinner was actually mandatory here, but if it was me I would want my bloody supper if I wasn’t getting another chance of a bite.</p>
      <p class="subsq">I pressed my ear against the wall, trying hard to make anything out. I could just about hear voices. Just about. The girls did share studies, though, so it was hard to know exactly whether that should concern me.</p>
      <p class="subsq">My eyes suddenly widened as the scent of cigarettes wafted around. The girls next door were deliberately keeping their voices down, even though they knew no-one else would be up here. Worried about anyone catching them. And one of them had lit a cigarette while they talked.</p>
      <p class="subsq">Violet must have already been in there, waiting for Sofia to get back.</p>
      <p class="subsq">I burst back out of the study I had borrowed and hurled open Sofia’s door just in time to hear her losing her cool.</p>
      <p class="subsq">“How the hell can you love me!? I don’t even know who you are!”</p>
      <p class="subsq">I got my first proper glimpse of Violet, only as long as those rather dispiriting words took to get out. Her mousy hair was unbrushed and messy and falling over her face. She was just wearing her short-sleeved uniform blouse and pleated skirt but not her blazer, and the bits she was wearing looked like they’d been worn for a couple of days in a row.</p>
      <p class="subsq">None of that really surprised me. The thing that caught my eye was her arms. Livid pink scars ran down the inside of both of them, and for an instant it made me think of Morse code. Lines and dots. Cuts and cigarette burns. She really had sliced herself to ribbons. Some of them were brand new. One was still bleeding.</p>
      <p class="subsq">How had no-one noticed? The girls shared dormitories, showered together, got dressed together. Violet hadn’t been missing. Surely someone had seen.</p>
      <p class="subsq">Tears were already running down Violet’s face when I opened the door. For a fraction of a second I could see the hurt as Sofia shouted at her.</p>
      <p class="subsq">And then the shock wave hit me and threw me back into the opposite door. Books and papers flew around the study too and I saw Sofia flying back and slamming into the study wall, but there was no sign of Violet. She had just vanished.</p>
      <p class="subsq">I managed to get my legs under me before I hit the ground, struggling to breathe for a second. Whatever had hit me, it had been like a punch in the stomach and knocked the breath out of me. I sprawled back against the door for a moment, wobbled as I found my feet, blinked my eyes clear and desperately tried to put my thoughts in order.</p>
      <p class="subsq">I jolted over the corridor and looked in to see if Sofia was moving around. Her mouth was moving, and I got the distinct impression she was swearing. I swallowed and my ears popped, the sound rushing back.</p>
      <p class="subsq">She was definitely swearing, loudly and in Italian, for extra emphasis.</p>
      <p class="subsq">But she wasn’t bleeding and was moving, and that was good enough for now. I turned back to the corridor, instinctively looking towards the back stairs that we’d originally come up this morning. Violet had a key.</p>
      <p class="subsq">Just like that I was running after an invisible girl and hoping to God that I wouldn’t look like an idiot.</p>
      <p class="subsq">“Violet!” I wheezed after her. I still couldn’t really take deep breaths, and my lungs were burning even after a few yards, but it was worth a try calling to her. If she had looked around, or slowed up for even a second, it would give me a better shot.</p>
      <p class="subsq">I was about four steps away from the door to the stairs as I heard the lock click open, and the door hauled itself open. At least I was going the right way. I lunged desperately forward as the door started slamming and managed to get my foot between it and the frame.</p>
      <p class="subsq">I grunted as the heavy wood slammed against my foot, but I ignored it, fighting to get my back leg to catch up so I could straighten up. The door banged again against my foot and I swore this time, but I wasn’t moving, and I shoved my arm through the crack in the door, grabbing down towards the handle that Violet must be using to hold it closed.</p>
      <p class="subsq">It was very odd to feel her skinny little wrist in my hand when I couldn’t see it, but I had grabbed hold of her, and I started to lean in, trying to get my shoulder through the gap too, forcing my weight against it to pull the door open as much as I could.</p>
      <p class="subsq">A white-hot point of pain lanced into my forearm, slicing through my jacket and blouse, and my fingers instinctively jolted open. A desperate foot kicked me hard in the shin, leaving me toppling backwards with nothing I could grab hold of. I saw the door moving and snatched my fingers back out, just in time to avoid them being caught.</p>
      <p class="subsq">I bounced down onto my backside, and had to stop and take a breath, but I was pushing myself up a moment after, just in time to hear the lock clacking back across.</p>
      <p class="subsq">We were supposed to be quiet and discrete and all of that. But I wasn’t letting her get away.</p>
      <p class="subsq">I gulped down as much air as I could, set my eyes directly on the lock and screamed at it. A metallic, ripping shriek that would send shivers down any spine. The air blurred and shivered, my gift coming when I called it. That’s why they called it a gift, my magic, mine to use, so keen to jump out it had been known to happen without meaning to.</p>
      <p class="subsq">Turquoise sparks licked off the brass lock, and the tangy, metallic scent of ozone flooded into the air. A second later the lock punched its way out of the door, sending splinters back into the stairwell.</p>
      <p class="subsq">I grabbed the door again, using the new hole as a handle, and throwing it open. It was so frustrating to do all that and just have an empty stairwell ahead of me, but I saw a momentary flash in the window on the half-landing below me, moving across and down. I kept on after her but not pushing too hard. I was very aware of how far the fall was, and she clearly wasn’t in the mood to quietly give it up.</p>
      <p class="subsq">I put one hand on each banister as I went, making sure she couldn’t easily double back on me, and if I tripped I wouldn’t just go face first into the steps. All the doors out from here were locked, so wherever she went she had to stop and turn the key again. As long as I was close enough to lunge at her it was fine.</p>
      <p class="subsq">She was just a couple of steps ahead of me as we went past the next window, and then I saw her feet pushing bits of debris aside on the second landing, where Patricia had smashed through this morning.</p>
      <p class="subsq">I picked up my pace, assuming she was going to try the door, but at the last moment I saw a length of wood lifting up off the floor and I had to lurch back as it swung at me. The wood didn’t vanish as she picked it up, so thankfully I could duck back enough to avoid it, but it cracked hard against the brickwork, spraying splinters at me.</p>
      <p class="subsq">I kept my eyes on the stick, watching as it jabbed vaguely at me. It did make me wonder why her cigarettes were always invisible, but something else she’d picked up wasn’t.</p>
      <p class="subsq">No time to worry about that.</p>
      <p class="subsq">Instincts took over. I was definitely not the best boxer, but Violet was a short, skinny scrap of a girl and I fancied my chances. My hands came up into a proper guard and I took slow but confident steps towards her.</p>
      <p class="subsq">The tip of the banister kept hesitantly jabbing at me, but she didn’t seem very keen to hit me, which I was very much in favour of, and I only needed to nudge her back a bit before she ran out of landing and had to make up her mind.</p>
      <p class="subsq">The broken banister twitched and stopped moving backwards as her foot found the top of the stairs.</p>
      <p class="subsq">Here it was.</p>
      <p class="subsq">She brought the stick back, far too slow to do anything worthwhile, and I jumped forward, shoving my forearm into the base of her makeshift baton, then swung my other hand into a very optimistic left hook at where I suspected her head would be.</p>
      <p class="subsq">It was a bloody dreadful punch that Staff Sergeant Palmer would be very disappointed at, but I did actually connect with a shoulder or a chin or something. I clocked her, and I saw the stick tumbling end over end down to the ground below. She’d stepped back away from me and over onto nothing.</p>
      <p class="subsq">I snatched at where her chest should be and managed to grab a handful of her blouse. I stepped back and yanked her with me. Her knee bumped against me as she found her footing and she was already pulling away from me. My knuckles whitened as I gripped hard at her shirt. I bit my tongue, trying to stifle a scream that would definitely have blown Violet’s head off, but something had cut my palm.</p>
      <p class="subsq">I wrapped my other arm around her, hugging the smaller girl against me, but she really wasn’t very keen on that at all. Her hands thumped at my back and she kicked my shin with a lot of vigour.</p>
      <p class="subsq">“Jesus, would you just... Stop it!”</p>
      <p class="subsq">She decided she wasn’t very keen on that and kicked me again, right in the same spot, where I already had a bruise.</p>
      <p class="subsq">I could feel her breathing, fast panicked pants that smelled like cigarettes.</p>
      <p class="subsq">I tried to think what would Bridget do in this situation. She had a wonderfully direct way of looking at the world.</p>
      <p class="subsq">I let Violet go for just about a second, but my left hand felt the back of her hair. I snatched at it, brought my head back and launched it at where her face had to be, right in line with my hand.</p>
      <p class="subsq">I heard a wet crunch, instantly followed by stars across my vision and white noise filling my ears. I had the sickening vertigo sensation of falling and for a moment I thought I had missed badly enough that I had concussed myself and was just about to fall to my death through the whole in the banister.</p>
      <p class="subsq">My backside bounced off the broken bits of the banister again, and I realised that I’d been hit by another shock wave, just like in the corridor, but a lot weaker. Before she’d thrown me into a door, last night she’d hurled Patricia across the stairwell. Now she’d pushed my hands off her and knocked me over, but nothing else.</p>
      <p class="subsq">“Violet!” I was panting too as I got back up. My arms and legs were heavy, but she couldn’t be doing much better. Using magic was exhausting, and if she could have hurt me I was certain that she would have. She didn’t have enough left in the tank.</p>
      <p class="subsq">I had to swallow again to make my hearing come back, but I could hear her footsteps ahead of me and saw another flash of her from the next window down.</p>
      <p class="subsq">I grumbled and kept on. She was running out of anywhere to go, and I stopped as I got to the bottom where we had come into the stairs this morning.</p>
      <p class="subsq">“Come on, love. Time to give it up.” I forced down some breaths.</p>
      <p class="subsq">I stayed at the foot of the stairs, still making sure she couldn’t come past me, but my eyes were locked on the door out into the school. But there was nothing doing there.</p>
      <p class="subsq">Out of the corner of my eye, I saw some splinters flatten and shift, like a foot was very carefully picking its way across, trying not to be heard, making for the steps down into the basement.</p>
      <p class="subsq">I blinked a few times and I could see a splat of blood hovering in the air, making the vague shape of her nose and mouth. My blood didn’t show on her blouse, but where her blood was over the top of her skin, it was visible.</p>
      <p class="subsq">I glanced down at my hand, remembering the cuts. Two parallel, very clean slices in my palm about an inch apart. I wasn’t bleeding too badly. Thanks to her blouse getting in the way, it had been shallow, but there was still a steady trickle, and she definitely had something sharp in there.</p>
      <p class="subsq">I swallowed and started off after Violet again. There were actual drips of blood on the steps down to the basement. She’d left the door open behind her, but it was absolutely pitch-black in there.</p>
      <p class="subsq">I shook my head, closed my eyes and looked for her. The better I knew her, the easier it was to see her magic. I’d spent the whole day looking for the signs of her, and now, even tired and aching and slightly bleeding, it came when I called, without reluctance.</p>
      <p class="subsq">I felt for the open doorway and quickly realised that there was nothing magical around it, and Violet was not waiting behind it to attack me. That was something.</p>
      <p class="subsq">And there were little dazzling, rainbow spots of her blood. Real, bright specks, alive with power. All blood was obvious in the occult realm, at least while it was still wet, but her blood crackled and shimmered. Just like mine.</p>
      <p class="subsq">As I stepped into the basement I immediately smelled tobacco smoke and heard wretched little sniffles.</p>
      <p class="subsq">“Alright, alright...” I reached an arm out ahead of me, my eyes still closed, no idea what I might be walking into, so I just went slowly following the drops of blood until I saw the sheen of Violet’s invisible shape.</p>
      <p class="subsq">She was squeezed into a little corner behind a heavy box, her knees hugged to her chest, alternating between desperate puffs on a cigarette and sobbing. Her whole face was lit up with shimmering kaleidoscope blood. I'd really got her good when I headbutted her. Bridget would be proud.</p>
      <p class="subsq">I stayed still for a second and tried to keep my voice calm and soft.</p>
      <p class="subsq">“Violet?”</p>
      <p class="subsq">There was a proper flurry of sobs before she stopped herself.</p>
      <p class="subsq">“My name’s Lissy. I promise I’m not here to hurt you, alright, love?”</p>
      <p class="subsq">No answer.</p>
      <p class="subsq">“I can see you.”</p>
      <p class="subsq">“How?” It was a whimper.</p>
      <p class="subsq">“Because I have magic too.”</p>
      <p class="subsq">There was a very long moment. “...What?”</p>
      <p class="subsq">“You have bad dreams, right? And sometimes people close to you start to feel what you feel? That’s what I got, anyway. Before I learned I had the gift.” I tried to put everything together. “And I think... It’s probably been going on for a little while, right? You get anxious and scared, and that makes people around you afraid of you... Makes it feel like they hate you, and they don’t even know why. When I was younger, I did it to my da. And I remember... It hurt so much to know I was the problem, but I couldn’t do anything to fix it.”</p>
      <p class="subsq">Violet whimpered and sniffed, and I watched the shape of her nod.</p>
      <p class="subsq">I took a couple of steps towards her, feeling the edge of the crate, then finding the wall above her head. I slowly turned and sat down against the wall beside her. I felt her slowly lean against me.</p>
      <p class="subsq">“I’m just going to tell you what I think. But you tell me if I’m wrong, alright?” I sighed. “I think that... You spent a while wishing you could just disappear, because it would make everyone happier. And one day you did. Vanished. You probably didn’t even realise it. And you found out that actually being invisible felt even worse.</p>
      <p class="subsq">“I think that you probably realised you could do it on purpose. And you learned that... I think maybe you can hide your scars that way. And you saw Sofia and Patricia flirting a bit and... You thought that Sof was talking to you, right? Like, she was looking right at you, but... She couldn’t see you, had no idea you were there.”</p>
      <p class="subsq">She didn’t tell me I was wrong.</p>
      <p class="subsq">I shook my head. “Did you mean to hurt Patricia?”</p>
      <p class="subsq">“No.”</p>
      <p class="subsq">“So, what happened?”</p>
      <p class="subsq">I heard the sound of her mouth opening and closing without actually making words, but eventually she got there. “...She saw me. I don’t know how. She did and... I can’t do it on purpose.” She was a bit indistinct. I didn’t think I had broken her nose, but she was definitely stuffy. “It just... Happened.”</p>
      <p class="subsq">“You wanted her to think that Sof stood her up, didn’t you? Make her feel like... Like you felt. Ignored. Hurt. Like your feelings didn’t matter.”</p>
      <p class="subsq">Another little nod.</p>
      <p class="subsq">“I’m sorry. I know that’s hard. All of this is hard.” That hung for a second. “Is your nose still bleeding?”</p>
      <p class="subsq">“I don’t think so.”</p>
      <p class="subsq">“Alright.”</p>
      <p class="subsq">We just sat together, and she sniffled a bit less and finished her ciggie.</p>
      <p class="subsq">“...Why are you being kind to me?”</p>
      <p class="subsq">I actually laughed. “Sure, what else am I going to do with you? If Penny catches you she’ll shoot you. If Bridget catches you, well, she won’t shoot you. But she’s got a much better punch than I do. I’m here because... I have the gift. And hopefully I understand you a bit better than them.”</p>
      <p class="subsq">She thought about that as she threw her fag end away. “The gift?”</p>
      <p class="subsq">“Doesn’t feel like a gift, does it?” I put my arm around her now that I didn’t have to dodge her ciggie. “I still... I have a lingering feeling that being rare and magical means that... People who love me tend to always be in harm’s way. Because if someone wanted to use your gift for whatever nasty things they could think of, well, the one thing they need is for you to feel alone and unloved, and like no-one could understand you.”</p>
      <p class="subsq">“Lissy?” It was Bridget’s voice coming from the stairwell. She must have been in Violet’s dorm when it all kicked off, and had only been two minutes behind me.</p>
      <p class="subsq">“I’m in here, Bette. I’ve got Violet here with me. She’s alright.” I cursed as I realised I had opened my eyes, looking towards the voice. But it didn’t matter. I could feel where Violet was. “This is Bridget. She’s my girlfriend. So, you be nice to her, alright?”</p>
      <p class="subsq">Violet nodded slightly. “...I’m sorry I burned you and all that...”</p>
      <p class="subsq">I tried not to dwell on that, but I probably would have a scar where she had jabbed me with her previous cigarette. Such was the life of an agent.</p>
      <p class="subsq">“It’s alright. We’ll look after you. But if you could be visible, that would help.”</p>

      <p class="first first-in-section first-full-width"><span class="first-phrase">I kept</span> my arm around Violet as I led her back into the stairwell and the daylight. I did really feel for her as I saw her. She’d certainly had a rough day.</p>
      <p class="subsq">I had properly caught her nose with my forehead, and she had quite a lot of blood down her face. That mixed with my blood on the front of her blouse, and she had very serious dark circles under her eyes. I supposed she hadn’t been to bed since she’d fired Patricia down the stairs.</p>
      <p class="subsq">She just looked small and sad and uncared for. Every time I caught sight of her forearms it made my throat go dry.</p>
      <p class="subsq">“Oh, you poor lamb...” I squeezed her shoulder as I saw the fresh cut on her. “Bette, have you got a hankie or something?”</p>
      <p class="subsq">“Should have something.” She rummaged in her satchel and came back with a dressing, gently pressing it to Violet’s arm.</p>
      <p class="subsq">Next to me Violet looked small, but next to Bridget she looked so tiny. I was obviously taller, but tall and skinny, so it didn’t show so much. Next to Bridget’s rather broad shoulders and compact, curvy build, scrawny little Violet looked about thirteen. But that was all for the good. Violet needed some big sisters right now.</p>
      <p class="subsq">There was the sound of a lock turning, and Penny’s ivory-handled pistol arrived in the stairwell ahead of her. For a second the muzzle stayed dead plumb on Violet, like she had known exactly where she was from the other side of the door.</p>
      <p class="subsq">After a second her eyes darted left and right and took me and Bridget in, and the automatic lowered. A bit. “Miss Sterling, I presume?”</p>
      <p class="subsq">I nudged Violet. “This is Penny. Or Lady Gough, if you find that sort of thing impressive.”</p>
      <p class="subsq">“I’m impressive enough all on my lonesome, I assure you.” She had a slightly shark-like look in her eyes, sounding flippant and easy but not relaxing even slightly. I supposed that was what years of work around dark wizards did to you. Never letting your guard down.</p>
      <p class="subsq">With a little delicacy she stepped up to Violet and slid the end of her pistol down the top of Violet’s blouse, catching a necklace over the barrel of the gun and dragging it out.</p>
      <p class="subsq">I winced. It was a razor blade. A real one. A sharp one. Hung on a cheap, silver-plated chain. Or actually it looked like two chains, attached end to end, each taken off a different necklace, to make one longer chain. It took me a moment to work out why. Anything that was physically on her when she turned invisible disappeared with her, but it didn’t quite happen on cue. She’d already been bleeding when I’d seen her in Sofia’s study, and she hadn’t made a new cut. So, sensibly enough, Violet had made sure that her blade would always vanish, that she couldn’t forget it.</p>
      <p class="subsq">The razor had my blood on the edge. But probably some of hers too.</p>
      <p class="subsq">Penny looked from the blade to Violet. “I’ll trade you.” She went into her handbag and came back with a necklace with an odd, nobly looking chunk of stone hanging from it. “It’s fulgurite. Fossilised lightning, you know? Fantastically rare. Not valuable, but it tends to damp down magical abilities.”</p>
      <p class="subsq">I gave Violet a quick nod. “It’s ok. It’s safe. Just... It’ll mean you won’t keep exploding, eh?”</p>
      <p class="subsq">She nodded slightly and undid the clasp on one of the chains.</p>
      <p class="subsq">I reached out to catch the razor. “You can have it back later, alright? If you want it.”</p>
      <p class="subsq">Violet took the necklace from Penny and put it over her head with a bit of ceremony. It didn’t seem to make any immediate difference to her, but I was careful not to touch it anyway. We hadn’t learned about those yet, and I wasn’t in a hurry to have anything happen to my magic, even if it was temporary.</p>
      <p class="subsq">“There we go.” Penny let her pistol drop down by her side, no longer pointing it at Violet. “You know what I think you might benefit from, Miss Sterling? A fresh start. New school, new friends, a bit of help with... Your specific challenges. And then you can put your best foot forward, what?”</p>
      <p class="subsq">Violet swallowed and nodded. “...I’d like that.”</p>
      <p class="subsq">“Splendid. I will make some calls.”</p>
      <p class="subsq">Penny about-turned and started off but Bridget managed to catch her arm.</p>
      <p class="subsq">“Pistol, Penny.”</p>
      <p class="subsq">“What?”</p>
      <p class="subsq">“In your hand.”</p>
      <p class="subsq">Penny looked down. “Oh. Well spotted.”</p>

      <p class="first first-in-section first-full-width"><span class="first-phrase">Blethers pulled</span> the Rolls Royce out of Batley College half an hour later. Violet was squeezed in the middle seat between me and Bridget, with Penny sitting in the jump seat beside the car’s built-in bar.</p>
      <p class="subsq">“Penny?” I caught her eye. “What did you tell them?”</p>
      <p class="subsq">She shrugged. “The usual.” She opened the little cabinet beside her and reached into the surprisingly deep compartment, taking out a bottle of champagne. “Our Violet had a little moment, and naturally she needs some specialist care for her own good. The agency will call her parents. The only person who feels there might be magic around is Sofia, but I have convinced her that she and Violet merely had an altercation. Job done.”</p>
      <p class="subsq">“When you say convinced...?” I remembered whatever it was Penny had done to Matron.</p>
      <p class="subsq">She laughed. “What is the least reliable form of evidence?”</p>
      <p class="subsq">“Eyewitnesses.” Bridget said it automatically.</p>
      <p class="subsq">“Indeed. Because they are strange things. They make things up, they notice the wrong details. And when you give them a credible explanation that matches the evidence then they’ll tend to say that yes, actually, our Violet, being ever so hysterical, hurled her into the wall with unexpected vigour. But no less than you might expect for a maniac.”</p>
      <p class="subsq">Penny popped the champagne cork and ferreted for a glass. “No offence intended of course, Miss Sterling. Just, regrettably, Sofia was predisposed to believe that. But you will never see her again, so I wouldn’t worry unduly about it.”</p>
      <p class="subsq">Violet squirmed a bit. We had very rapidly packed her things and vanished into the evening, but we hadn’t actually talked about what came next. “I’m really never going back?”</p>
      <p class="subsq">“No.” Penny didn’t miss a beat. “For the best though, eh? Where exactly you’ll go next, that’s a question for another day.” She poured a glass and offered it to Violet.</p>
      <p class="subsq">The younger girl took it hesitantly, like she thought it might be a trap, but Penny just let her take it, turned back and found another glass.</p>
      <p class="subsq">“It will probably take a day or two to sort out in any case. I can promise you it will be a very nice school.”</p>
      <p class="subsq">I smirked. “Penny doesn’t really believe that not-nice schools exist.”</p>
      <p class="subsq">“Oh, I believe in them, but only in the same way that I believe in interest rates and so on.” Penny carried on chatting happily enough. “I know they are out there somewhere, but it’s not awfully important for me to involve myself directly.”</p>
      <p class="subsq">She handed me another flute. “In any case, assuming Professor Beaumont is amenable, we will bed you down at Blackhurst with Lissy and Bridget over the weekend. Or if the worst comes to the worst you can stay with me at the town house until we find somewhere else to put you.” Another flute went to Bridget.</p>
      <p class="subsq">Violet took her first sip of champagne. “What’s Blackhurst? And... Who exactly are you anyway?”</p>
      <p class="subsq">Penny poured her own flute and pushed the bottle back into the ice bucket deep inside the bar. She passed her glass to her left hand and offered Violet her right. “Penelope Gough, Queen’s agent.”</p>
      <p class="subsq">She waited for Violet to cautiously shake her hand.</p>
      <p class="subsq">Penny grinned. “By the grace of God, witch hunter to Her Majesty. Not that we care much about witches, but you get the idea. Magic really isn’t the problem, it’s what you do with it. And if your magic falls off the straight and narrow, someone like me shows up.”</p>
      <p class="subsq">“...And Lissy and Bridget are, what? Ladies-in-waiting?”</p>
      <p class="subsq">“Well, in so many words.” Penny laughed. “They are students at Blackhurst. The agency training college.”</p>
      <p class="subsq">“...Right.” Violet sipped her champagne again, but she was clearly bursting to ask.</p>
      <p class="subsq">Penny waved her down. “All in good time. In any case, you are too young to go right to Blackhurst, even if you do arrive eventually. But before all that...” She looked from me to Bridget. “Your first case, ladies. Concluded in just a couple of hours, and you’ll be back to college before ten o’clock. Very solid work.”</p>
      <p class="subsq">She looked a bit wan. “They will not all end so quickly or so happily. But I am glad I brought you. I may well have ended it more quickly, but not more happily.” She looked back to Violet. “Did Lissy let her guard down? Take a chance that you might kill her?”</p>
      <p class="subsq">“No. She, er… She headbutted me.”</p>
      <p class="subsq">Bridget was instantly sniggering.</p>
      <p class="subsq">“Well, that’s a start.” Penny raised her glass. “Your first case ladies, I’m sure there will be many more.”</p>
